<h3>Lectures Without PowerPoint</h3>
Sync-O-Matic is capable of dealing with various sequences of images
other than those produced by a PowerPoint.
<p>
These images may come from any number of sources:
<ul>
<li>
A scanner - These slides may come from a live lecture where the speaker brought "real" overheads.  See the
<a href=http://webcast.cern.ch/Projects/WebLectureArchive/>CERN Web Lecture Archive Project</a> for an excellent example of the use of scanned slides.
<p>
<li>
Some people use PhotoShop or some other program to develop their images because they
prefer it.
</ul>
<p>
With the <b>Liberal Slide Names</b> option enabled,
Sync-O-Matic looks for files with either the .jpg or .gif extension in the lecture directory.  When you select a directory, it scans the directory to see the images that it can find and then it sorts them alphabetically.  So a good naming convention is quite useful.
<BR CLEAR=ALL><HR>
<A NAME=010gifseries> </a>
<A HREF=010gifseries.htm>
<IMG SRC=010gifseries.gif BORDER=0 
 ALT='Click Here for a large version of the image' 
WIDTH=320 ALIGN=RIGHT>
</A>
<!-- file:010gifseries-->
This is an example of a naming convention which has worked for some users.  Prefix each file
with a number 010 020 030 040 ....  This way you can insert a few more images without
renumbering too badly.  With the three digit numbers, you can let the rest of the file be descriptive.

<!-- file:020titlesfile-->
You can optionally create a file called <b>titles.txt</b> to indicate the "title" for each image used in the on-line lecture index for jumping randomly around the lecture.
<p>
This file is <i>not</i> required and if present, it does not need to have a line for every image.  It can have lines for images not used in this lecture.
<p>
The double quotes around the image file name and the title are required. lines with '#' in
the first column are comments as are blank lines.

</A>
<!-- file:030notesfile-->
Also optional is a file which contains the "notes" for the slide.  This is similar to using the notes area in PowerPoint.  The naming convention for the <b>.not</b> files is to use the identical name as the image file with the .not suffix.
<p>
The notes files are simple HTML, you can put in hrefs or other HTML stuff like
<a href=http://www.netfact.com/syncomat>this</a>.

To record the lecture with this directory and these images, open it using <b>Open Lecture</b>, selecting the directory.  However, because Sync-O-Matic is looking for slides with the PowerPoint naming convention, no slides are found.
<p>
We must enable the liberal slide naming mode.

Once the flag is turned on, the directory is re-scanned and the image files are found.
<P>
You can use the <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> to scan to see if Sync-O-Matic has found all the slides you think should be there.
<P>
It is important <i>not</i> to use this mode on directories which have been created from a PowerPoint-97 <B>Save As HTML</b> process.  PowerPoint puts about 8 extraneous GIF images into the directory for various purposes including advertising Internet Explorer.  If these directories are used with <b>Liberal Slide Names</b> turned on, these extraneous GIF images will be part of the lecture.

A lecture is recorded the same as any other lecture.  Once you have set up the audio/video capture, you are presented with the slide viewer screen.  You can resize this and move it around before or during the lecture.
<p>
When you have gathered your thoughts, press <b>+</b>.

The recording process has added two files <b>images.txt</b> and <b>rawmedia.rm</b>.
<p>
The <b>images.txt</b> file contains the timing information as to when the images are to be displayed.  The <b>rawmedia.rm</b> file contains the encoded RealMedia.

Looking at the lecture, your images are displayed and looking at the index, the titles
specified in <b>titles.txt</b> will be shown in the drop-down menus and other places in the lecture.

This gives a brief overview of how you can work with the Sync-O-Matic files directly.  Many
users get to the point where they manage the files in these directories directly, bypassing all of the slick Sync-O-Matic processes.  When they have things all set, they start Sync-O-Matic and simply press <b>Publish Lecture</b>.
<p>
One of the advantages of Sync-O-Matic when compared to other web-lecture systems is that
nearly all of its operation can be examined and done manually.  The whole design is set
up to give users both convenience and flexibility.
