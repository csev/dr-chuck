I told you there would be some quick updates.  Version 1.13 is out right now
and version 1.14 will be out tomorrow morning (so I am sending one note).

No major problems to report.  The biggest in 1.13 is the ClipBoard Import
function did not work because of some additional error checking I added 
too early in the code.  The more frustrating news is that once I got that
fixed, I found that RealProducer on the PC seems not to be able to handle too
many different Quicktime video/audio types.  Quicktime can play the material 
on the PC, Real just can't encode it.  The good news is that RealProducer 
7 beta 3 on the Mac seems to be much more comfortable with Quicktime.

Version 1.14 (tomorrow) will (at least) have more descriptive messages in
several places, and support doing the Quicktime->Real conversion on the Mac.
Unfortunately, it will require an extra manual step in a process (ClipBoard
Import) that I hoped to completely automate.
