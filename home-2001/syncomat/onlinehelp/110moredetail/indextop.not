<h3>Using the Sync-O-Matic 2000 Power User Interface</h3>
<p>
This is the power user mode of Sync-O-Matic. It exposes more of the capability of Sync-O-Matic and allows you to view more of the information used by Sync-O-Matic while making and publishing lectures.   This mode is used once someone gets used to how the data is laid out on disk and once the bugs are worked out of their production process.

It is possible under Preferences to indicate that this mode is to be the default mode on startup.
