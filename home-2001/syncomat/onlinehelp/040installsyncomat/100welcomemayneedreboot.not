<!-- file:100welcomemayneedreboot-->
Setup initially puts up a screen (white background with blue test) as several files needed for the setup process are installed.  You may actually have to reboot at this time and when the system reboots re-run startup.

This reboot at this point should only happen once, and generally it won't happen again even if you remove and reinstall Sync-O-Matic or other packages developed in Visual Basic 5.0.
