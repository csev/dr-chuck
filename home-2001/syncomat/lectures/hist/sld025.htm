Interestingly, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) was invented about the same time as Gopher.  HTML is the language used to “mark-up” the hypertext aspects of web documents and to interate the multimedia aspects of the documents into the text portions of the documents.

However because there was no free software available to view HTML effectively it was not immediately a hit.  HTML was over two years old when Mosaic was developed at NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications) at university of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1993.

Mark Andreesen had an $20,000 SGI on the desk at NCSA - So did everyone else at NCSA - assumed graphics, networking, an multimedia three years before it was commonplace.</UL> </P>
