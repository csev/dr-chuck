Update on Version 1.7.  Thanks to Dave Meyer and Steve Ricketts, some
nasty little style bugs have been quickly identified and are now fixed
on the web.  The bugs showed up when you did audio-only lectures.

The updated information is in

http://www.egr.msu.edu/~crs/projects/syncomat/install/syncinfo.zip

Just extract this file right over top of the old stuff.  (Good reason
to name any of your self-created style directories diferently than mine
:) )
