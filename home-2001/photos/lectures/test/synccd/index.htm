Welcome to this web-based lecture.  You can select the segment of
the lecture and how the lecture is displayed from the options below.
  This was prepared for CD-ROM Delivery - note it will NOT work if uploaded to the web.
When playing from local disk - Only the single-frame style
will work because of relative paths.
<UL>
<LI> Part 1 <br>
<a href=f001.htm> Audio </a> <BR>

This style is the standard style for the
<a href=http://www.netfact.com/syncomat/>
Sync-O-Matic
</a>
program.
It makes good use of the Javascript capabilities of Sync-O-Matic.
If browsers fail with this
style, then you should try the simpler style.
<p>
It is intended that you edit this index.htm file
and add your own picture, etc - You may also not want
to give all of the above options to the user.
<p>
The file inst160.gif in this directory is used to show the instructor picture for
audio-only versions of the lecture.  You can replace this picture for all lectures using
the standard style by replacing {Application Directory}\style\sync2k\inst160.htm on the 
machine that produces these lectures.
<p>
It supports a frame-style view or a separate player and browser window.  It is the most 
heavily used style and is rather complex.  If you are developing your own style it might be best to start with a simpler style.
<P>
