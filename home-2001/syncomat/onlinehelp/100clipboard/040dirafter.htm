This shows the contents of the directory after the lecture has been recorded.  The files of interest are the image files, the <b>images.txt</b>, and the <b>rawmedia.mov</b> files.
<p>
The other files describe the scribbling, typing, and pointing that ClipBoard-2000 supports through Quicktime they are not used by Sync-O-Matic (at least so far).
<p>
We use some file transfer to move the files to the PC.  This can be FTP or some shared directory.
