Our first goal is to test the RealProducer.  Because Syncomat deals directly with RealProducer using a programmatic interface (ActiveX), you may never have to run RealProducer separately.

But if you cannot record video and audio using RealProducer, you most likely will not be able to record using Syncomat.

Select the input from the audio and video media and give an output file such as <b>C:\temp\temp.rm</b>. 

Then press <b>OK</b>.
