Sync-O-Matic Newsletter-26

Hello,

I can use a little help from the existing Sync-O-Matic users.

I am writing a grant to the NSF which describes the next steps I am 
planning on taking in the ClipBoard/Syncomat area. The grant is due 
June 6 (pretty soon now).

If you would like, you can do me a favor and look it over. Any 
comments would be much appreciated. As part of the grant I would
like to have a few E-Mails from a few existing users to attach as 
letters of support.

The basic things to cover in the E-Mail are: Is ClipBoard a good 
thing? Would you like to see a Personal Lecture Repository? Do you 
think the grant should be funded? Who are you and why does your 
opinion matter :) ?

Thanks in advance - the URL is
