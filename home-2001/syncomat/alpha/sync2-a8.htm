<h1>Changes in This version</h1>
Sync-O-Matic 2000 Version Alpha-8
<p>
Changes:
<ul>
<li>
Continued to remove the dependence of the new version on the ActiveX control.  I keep finding this stuff because of the Fermi problems with NT/Sync-O-Mat/Non-admin account.
This time I had to fix a dependence on the ActiveX control as it is loading the information about a lecture.  It was ALWAYS using the ActiveX control to determine if a particular .rm file was audio or audio and video.  Now if the ActiveX control is not there we have to ask the user - what a bummer.  But at least it seems as thought the code can operate without the ActiveX control at all.
</ul>
<h3>To Do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add a way to access registration info in a style
<li>More styles - the Andrew styles and the SMIL style
<li>Testing testing testing
<li>Test all the way back to the realencoder 3.0 without the ActiveX stuff at all
<li> Way out: Add AVI capture, Think about Sync-O-Matic-1000 :)
</ul>
