Another use of TimeIT is to hand-enter times from some other source than FlipIT.

Press the <b>Reset</b> button to clear out any extraneous values.  With the first row
selected, enter <b>sld001.htm</b> in the <b>Slide</b> field and the start time for slide one in the <b>Start Time</b> field.  Then press the <b>Enter</b> key.  The data will be entered and a new line will be inserted.  The key is to press <b>Enter</b> after you put in the start time values.

Once you get started, you can type a series of start times, each followed by <b>Enter</b> without using the mouse.  If you make mistakes, you can navigate through the timings, adding, deleting and editing values.
