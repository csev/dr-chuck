Start Sync-O-Matic and after you have opened the proper lecture, you will notice that the publish button is enabled because the <b>rawmedia.rm</b> file exists - go ahead and publish the lecture normally.

The lecture can be published from either the <b>Less Detail</b> or <b>More Detail</b> screens in Sync-O-Matic.
