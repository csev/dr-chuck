After setup completes, the most important thing is to see the preview video on the left screen.  If the preview video is not there, you may have your camera/capture card installed improperly or have chosen the wrong driver.
<P>
Three new buttons are also now available.  These buttons allow you to adjust the video settings, using them you may or may not be able to fix non-working video.
<P>
Each of these dialogs is different based on the camera or video capture device.
<P>
We will look at each in turn.
<P>
To adjust audio, use the volume control icon in the system tray.  See the
<a href=../030installrealproducer/index.htm>Installing and Testing RealProducer</a> documentation for details on properly setting the audio levels.
