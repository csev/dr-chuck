Sync-O-Matic 3000 Newsletter: Number 15

Welcome to the Sync-O-Matic 3000 newsletter - the last letter was about
4 months ago.  I am indeed at my new job at the University of Michigan.
In the past four months, I have not put in a lot of effort on Sync-O-Mat
because I have been ferociously developing a completely new product
called the ClipBoard-2000 which I hope to have into Beta test in a week
or so.

ClipBoard will initially only run on a Mac and uses Quicktime instead of
Real.  But it is SOOO much easier to use, is more reliable and has lots 
of slick features.  Sync-O-Mat is still more flexible but later versions 
of ClipBoard will put the flexibility back in.   As Sync-O-Mat users, 
you will be the ones that I offer the Beta-test.  So get your Macs 
dusted off....

Once I get ClipBoard out into Beta I am planning on going back to
Sync-O-Mat and producing a 2.0 release with improved style files.  Also
if things work out I will be doing a complete revamp of the install
process and the documentation for Sync-O-Mat over the next couple of
months.  The goal is so that people can actually use the darn thing just
by reading the documentation without having to call me on the cel-phone :).

I will be giving a tutorial at the Frontiers in Education conference
November 10-13 in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The tutorial will cover both
Sync-O-Mat and ClipBoard-2000.  Dr. Enbody of Michigan State will discuss
how he has used the tools in his on-line C++ course at MSU.  I would
love to see you all there at the workshop or at the rest of the
conference.  The URL for the conference is

Over the summer, Sync-O-Matic was used ar CERN - High Energy Physics
facility to capture an entire summer program of introductory lectures on
high-energy physics.  I would encourage you to take a look at the
repository.  Steven Goldfarb and Etienne Falaise were the folks who put
this whole thing together.  I just went over, drank coffee, ate
escargot, and soaked in the beautiful scenery!   The URL is

So, in short, sorry for being so unresponsive these past few months.
I should be sending out another note in a week or so regarding
ClipBoard-2000.

And as always, this list is maintained by a human (me).  If you want to
be removed or updated, just send me a note at csev@umich.edu - no
particular format - just tell me what you want.
