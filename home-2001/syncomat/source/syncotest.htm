This is a subset of the code for Sync-O-Matic 3000 - these are the basic
utility functions and the tools which interact with the Internet, Real, and PowerPoint.
<p>
I am publishing this code because these ActiveX controls/library routines are NASTY 
to deal with so hopefully by sharing code,  we can end up with more reliable 
interactions with these tools.

You may reuse this code in non-commercial efforts, but must first get permisson for the

Please feel free to submit bugs and/or bug fixes - to Charles Severance.

Before loading this code, make sure to have Office-97, Realplayer, and RealProducer installed 
or the project will have reference problems.  If you have problems during loading, it is OK,
just don't save the project - you can load repeatedly until things work out.
<p>
This code is "most tested" under Visual Basic version 5.0 SP3 - it turns out the SP3 fixes a bug
in the FTP control.  It may or may not work with VB6.
<p>
Some issues:
<p>
- FTP uses the Microsoft INET control - this is pretty weak and does not give the application
much feedback - it hangs from time to time, especially uploading over a slow phone line
<p>
- RealRecord takes a long time to wake up to initialize all of the RealProducer stuff - this may
easily take 15 or 20 seconds.
