Some of the comanies which work with streaming media, develop their own protocol which allows them to adapt to changing network conditions.  Often the company makes their money selling server licenses while giving away the viewer and encoder.  More recently companies (<a href=http://www.vivo.com)>www.vivo.com)</a> areusing standard protocols to stream their data which is much more cost effective.

Often while companies feel that a proprietary protocol has some inherent advantages, often there are disadvantages as well.  Given that the use of a proprietary protocol often has a cost factor involved, usually approaches which use a standard protocol will be more successful in the long run.</UL> </P>
