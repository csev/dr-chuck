This will replace any existing Sync-O-Matic installation, so to use 
Sync-O-Matic 3000 (older version)
you must reinstall it over top of Sync-O-Matic 2000 Alpha.  
It is no big deal to install one and then
the other. Just try to make sure to uninstall one before reinstalling the other.
<h3>Source Code</h3>
The source code to Sync-O-Matic is available for purchase for sites who would like to have a copy for their
own use.  If your institution has a significant repository of Sync-O-Matic materials
which can be referenced in the 
<a href=../gallery.htm>
gallery of web-based lectures</a>,
please contact us regarding special purchase terms.
<p>
The source code to some of the more complex modules with interactions with various
ActiveX controls is available in hopes that other folks can help figure out good cannonical 
ways to interact with these ActiveX controls.  Part of the goal is for people to test and examine
these controls and send back feedback/bugs so these capabilities can be improved in
future versions of Sync-O-Matic.
