This is the screen when the events file has been deleted and the media control has been switched to <b>Play Media</b>.
<P>
To time this lecture, press
<b>Next</b>.
<P>
Playing works the same as recording with one small difference.  When the media being played finishes, the timing process is automatically stopped.  So on the last slide, simply wait until the media finishes instead of pressing the <b>X</b> button.   It is also possible to stop the timing by pressing the <b>X</b> button before the media completes playing.
