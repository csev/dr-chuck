You can optionally create a file called <b>titles.txt</b> to indicate the "title" for each image used in the on-line lecture index for jumping randomly around the lecture.
<p>
This file is <i>not</i> required and if present, it does not need to have a line for every image.  It can have lines for images not used in this lecture.
<p>
The double quotes around the image file name and the title are required. lines with '#' in
the first column are comments as are blank lines.
