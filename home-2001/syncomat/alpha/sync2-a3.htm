<h1>Changes in This version</h1>
Sync-O-Matic 2000 Version Alpha-3
<ul>
<li>Added Support for streaming lectures - user Advanced mode to trigger the prompts
<li>Added two messages indcating that multi-part lectures (food1.rm food2.rm...) are deprecated - this is rwally a survey to see if anyone is still using this feature.
The use of audio in .ra files is also deprecated.  They should simply be renamed to the same name with .rm.  Sync-O-Matic-2000 actually looks in the file and can tell if it has any video or just has audio.
<li>Changed the new sync2k style information
<li>Changed the order of the Style Directory and the Publish Directory prompts
<li>Added more speeds to the encoding and recording process - used a pick list
<li>Changed the was that image timings are stored.  Now they are stored in images.txt 
using the ClipBoard-2000 format.  This replaces the rawmedia.txt files.  Users who downloaded alpha versions should scan their disk looking for "rawmedia.txt" and rename them all to "syncomat.txt".
<li>Cleaned up the gallery page on the web site
<li>Allowed any size of GIF image in the sync2k style file
<li>Made it possible to  use any arbitrary sequence of GIF or JPG files for a lecture.
This even allows notes files with these images - see theonline documentation.
<li>You can create a file called titles.txt which maps image file names to titles.
<li>Wrote a bunch of new documentation on the website - the documentation is basically complete.
<li>Rewrote how Sync-O-Mat reads text files to allow it to directory read unconverted Macintosh text files.
</ul>
