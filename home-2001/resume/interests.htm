<h1>Interests</h1>
My research interests are an eclectic blend of computer science and 
educational technology.  To me the ultimate goal of research is to make
the world a better place.  To that end, I try to choose research areas
which have the potential for real impact outside my academic community.  
Nearly all of my research has resulted in some type of impact beyond 
the world of journal publications and grants.  I enjoy exploring the 
applications and uses of computing and technology.
<p>
My current research focus is on developing new tools for the delivery of
education on-line.
I believe that this is a difficult and challenging problem that is still 
far from solved.
I have developed two tools, Sync-O-Matic 3000 and ClipBoard-2000 in an attempt
to make on-line teaching as easy and pleasant as possible for the teachers
and learners.  Both of these tools are in use around the country at a number
of institutions to make on-line content.
I believe that the only approach to using new
media in education is to begin using the media and continuously 
learn from these experiences.
<p>
In addition to research in educational technology,
my research interests include: high performance computing, 
scientific visualization, computer architecture, 
parallel processing, Internet applications and networking.
I fundamentally believe that we will always have the need for computers
which are many times faster than our personal computers.  Regardless of
the capability of a single computer, we will continue to "lash" 
computers together to solve larger and more complicated problems.
These large scale computers are often difficult to use compared to 
personal computers.  High performance computing education is an important
field in its own right.  To that end I have written a book, titled 
High Performance Computing, published by O'Reilly and Associates which
is meant to make these computers more understandable.
<p>
I have a broad interest in teaching.  I enjoy teaching advanced classes in 
my area of expertise to advanced students.  I also enjoy teaching the
very earliest classes where students begin to become aware of the
power of computing.  I look at teaching in two ways.  First, I teach to 
share my knowledge.  Second, I teach to learn.  We all must be life-long 
learners and to be a teacher is to be a learner.  To this end I would like to
teach classes outside my field of expertise as a learning experience.
Someday I imagine teaching classes in mathematics, physics, 
economics, and many other fields in addition to my computer 
and technology oriented classes.
<p>
I believe that research and teaching are inseparable.  Better research
leads to more useful instruction and by teaching, we create new researchers 
and research opportunities.  I feel that the best class is one where the 
student is given more questions than answers while also getting the tools 
to answer those questions. 
<p>
I also feel that it is important to share our skills and knowledge outside the
higher education community.  To this end I regularly give presentations to 
community groups on a wide variety of topics.  I try to use television and
radio to interact with an audience beyond the university.
I am a regular guest on the program
NewsTalk-870 aired on WKAR radio.
I am one of the co-hosts of an award-winning television show
Nuthin' but Net produced by MediaOne appearing monthly.
Before Nuthin but Net, I was a co-host of another
talk show about the Internet titled
Internet:TCI.  The show won
several national and regional awards during its lifetime.
In addition I have given numerous interviews on local news programs in the
Lansing area as an expert in Internet and Technology.
