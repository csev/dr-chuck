This is a trip to Michigan Adventure with a neighbor friend - Trisha.  At the same time,
Uncle Greg took his family on the same day.  Interestingly, the last time we went to
Michigan Adventure (2 years ago), Uncle Scott was there too - all unplanned.

Camera was left in the car for the first 1/2 of the day - the shadows are already lengthening.  This is Dave, Trish, Teresa and Brent in line for the Mad Mouse.
