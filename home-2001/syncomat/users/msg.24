Sync-O-Matic Newsletter-24

Alpha Version 4 of Sync-O-Matic 2000 is now out.  This is the first release which
does NOT have a corresponding Sync-O-Matic 3000 release.  The code has diverged.  
But the good news is that while -2000 is off on its own, I got enough feedback from 
existing users to convince me to retain some of the -3000 interface (updated to be
consistent with -2000).  The -3000 look still lives under the "More Detail" option.
But now the two views are both working from the same set of preferences and have the
same naming conventions.

For heavy users of -3000, there are some preference settings (See ${lecparent}) which
allow you to simulate the old directory layout.  Let me know if you need help
setting preferences.  In a while I will write some documentation on how to set 
preferences.

I removed the "Advanced Mode" of -2000, moving it into the "More Details" option.

With a lot of little changes, the on-line documentation is mildly out of date and 
the new "More Details" stuff is undocumented :(.  But existing -3000 users will 
feel pretty much at home.  Lecture name and class name are gone.  They are now just a 
path.  The lecture name is derived from the last directory in the path.  It is shown
in this version just for debug.

This version is also now officially NAGWARE!  No password is necessary to download 
it and install it.  It starts working (and nagging) right away.  Stopping the nagging
is oh-so-easy.  Go to registration in preferences and enter (yes, you guessed it)
"bob" (no quotes).  Hey I am even asking for a shareware-style registration for new
users, but people can use it forever without ever giving me a cent - the best software 
is free software...

TTFN.
