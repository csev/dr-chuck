Sync-O-Matic Newsletter-23

Hello all, the Alpha test of Sync-O-Matic 2000 has begun.  Actually 
it is already version Alpha-2.  I did a limited release last week
and found a few things to fix.  There will be more.

At the same time, I released version 1.16 of Sync-o-Matic 3000 with 
all of the same bugs fixed.  

So, if you are not a regular Sync-O-Matic 3000 user or had problems getting 
it to work prefiously, I strongly recommend the new product (-2000).The new
URL is:

The password as always, is bob

I will try to co-release both the old program (-3000) and the new program
(-2000) as long as practical.  By the time I drop support for -3000, 
-2000 will have all of the features of -3000 and much more.

I encourage you to download -2000 and try it out.  The next few weeks will 
focus on bug fixes and a few new features.  The more people who test it, 
the quicker the bugs will get fixed.

Sync-O-Matic-2000 has documentation already - actually nearly 20 pages of stuff
with over 100 screenshots and explanations.  THAT alone is a good reason to
switch to -2000!.

TTFN.
