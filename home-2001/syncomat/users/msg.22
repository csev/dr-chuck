Sync-O-Matic Newsletter-22

Sorry for taking up so much bandwidth.  Version 1.15 is out.  Last night, I got
the idea that I would see how much of the new Sync-O-Matic 2000 interface I 
could get to work..  

Verson 1.15 has the Sync-O-Matic 2000 interface under the Test | Sync-2K 
menu item.  For reasons that are still unknown to me, I made it so 
that either user interface could be used interchangably.  You can even watch
the two interfaces using the Test | Dual-Mode option.  Kind of weird.

For people struggling with using Sync-O-Matic 3000, you might just like the 
new interface a lot.  It tells you what to do at each step - more like 
a wizard.

Once I rewrote the FTP upload code in Verson 1.14, I completed the last
"rewrite and make easier" task on my list to port the Sync-O-Matic 2000 
code back to Sync-O-Matic 3000.

From this point forward, most of my effort will be on the new Sync-O-Matic 
2000 user interface, focusing on bugs and ease of use, and features.

I have a request as a graphically-challenged engineer-type - I would much
appreciate it if someone could come up with some graphic elements to make
the interface look like something other than a Visual Basic programmer 
nightmare.  The pay is not so great - but think of the pride you would
get...  The problem is that it is hard to get into writing some documentation
when the look and feel of the UI is not tied down somewhat.

TTFN.
