<h1>Changes in This version</h1>
Sync-O-Matic 2000 Version Beta-4 
<p>
This version adds a whole bunch of features - and is more like an Alpha test for those new features.  So, if you experience
problems with this release,  you might want to try Beta-3.  There is one new "non-server" feature in this release - 
It automatically can "parse" a previously published lecture and extract a limited amout of the information from the lecture
to allow republishing in case the original materials were lost.
<ul>
<li>
The events information is extracted from the *.rat files and converted into the original "*.txt" format.
<li>
The "Slide Index" titles are extracted from the first navigation file (n001.htm, an001.htm, or vn001.htm) and placed in "titles.txt"
<li>
It turns out that the RealProducer ActiveX control deletes the "events" track when adding a new track - so there was no need to remove the events
track.  This does mean that lectures get turned into RealPlayer 8 (YUCK!) or higher when you redo them.  If you want to use Real 5, everything works, 
but you must extract the events tracks by hand.  You must use the rmtools to perform this :(.
</ul>
<h2>Server Edition</h2>
<p>
This is intended to allow you to upload an unpublished lecture to a repository and have it auto-published on the server, while making an archival 
(repository) copy of the lecture.  The idea is to not do the "Make Lecture" process on the client and upload the files.  The new Sync-O-Matic 3000
interface has had this "mysterious" upload to repository feature - that will upload a lecture to a repository, but you still have to rename it, as described below.
After the server side stuff is is a little more solid, I can put the rename in automatically.
<p>
Documentation is still to be written on the Server Edition - but this page will be a "core-dump" of its features
<ul>
<li>In the advanced mode, you can switch to server mode.
<li>There are also new preferences for server mode
<li>Also in the "Advanced" preferences, if you put "Server" in the Yes/No field the program will come up in server mode directly.  In a future release it will trigger 
"auto" as well to allow a fully-lights-out operation.  Assuming that it works of course :)
<li>If you don't want streaming, just leave it blank in the preferences
<li>Generally, even with all of the buttons, it is intended to work in "auto" mode all of the time.  The buttons are really for testing 
more than production use.
</ul>
In auto mode, the program scans the "Incoming directory" hierarchy, looking for recently uploaded unpublished lectures.  
Sync-O-Mat identifies completed incoming lecture directories because these lectures have an "x-" prefix prepended to their name.  
The "x-" is necessary because Sync-O-Mat needs to leave directories
alone until the upload is complete - at the end of the upload, the user renames the directory from "food" to "x-food" and within 10 
seconds, the server process should kick in.
<p>
Once a directory is found, it is moved into the "repository" hierarchy and the "x-" is removed.  Then Sync-O-Matic
is run to publish a web-version of the lecture to the designated location.
<p>
There is a log file (often in web space) used to keep track of the publication process.
<p>
The server process uses a slightly different naming convention for its paths and URLs.  
Within the incoming directory, you can just put in a bunch of lectures - or you can make a whole hierarchy for
different classes/organizations, etc - The server edition will maintain the relative paths from incoming through the repository
and to the web.
<p>
As I said above, this is the first release of the Server Edition stuff and so it will (as always) need a bit of tweaking as it gets deployed
in places other than the Dr. Chuck testing lab.
