<!-- file:010gifseries-->
This is an example of a naming convention which has worked for some users.  Prefix each file
with a number 010 020 030 040 ....  This way you can insert a few more images without
renumbering too badly.  With the three digit numbers, you can let the rest of the file be descriptive.
