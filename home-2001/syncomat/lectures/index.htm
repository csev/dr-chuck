<h3>Internet and Technology</h3>
This page contains most of the lectures in a course developed and taught by
<a href=http://www.dr-chuck.com/ target=_new>Dr. Charles Severance</a> from 1997-1999
while he was at <a href=http://www.vu.msu.edu/ target=_new>Michigan State University</a>.  
<p>
This course was one of the very earliest full length college courses delivering the entire lecture content 
with synchronized multimedia viewable over a modem.
The course was much of the impetus for developing and improving Sync-O-Matic.
The lectures are here in case you find them interesting.

Currently these are delivered using pseudo-streaming, so any random navigation, such as using thumbnails, will be slow, especially over a modem.  Once the streaming server is in place, we will put all of the course lectures up at this site.
