<H3> Solving Problems with Viewing the lecture</H3>
This page is designed to help you with problems while viewing the lectures. 
The problems which you may encounter will fall into several categories.
<ul>
<li>
It is important to have the proper version of the RealPlayer installed on your computer.
You should install the Realplayer available at no charge
from <a href=http://www.real.com/products/player/ target=_top>
www.real.com/products/player/</a>.  If you have problems with the G2 Beta 
player you may want to try the version 5 player.

<li>You connection is behind a firewall which will not pass the streaming protocol - 
you can view the lecture using pseudo-streaming or via a direct download.
