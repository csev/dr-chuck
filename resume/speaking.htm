<b>Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) - Past, Present, and Future</b>
<p>
This presentation will explore what it was like when MOOCs were first emerging in 2012 and talk about what we have learned from the experience so far.  Today, MOOC providers are increasingly focusing on becoming profitable and this trend is changing both the nature of MOOCS and university relationships with MOOC platform providers.   Also, we will look at how a university can scale the development of MOOCs and use knowledge gained in MOOCs to improve on-campus teaching.  We will also look forward at how the MOOC market may change and how MOOC approaches and technologies may ultimately impact campus courses and programs.
</p>
<p>
<b>Experiences Teaching a Massively Open Online Course (MOOC)</b><br/>
Dr. Severance teaches
"Internet History, Technology, and Security"
and
"Programming for Everybody"
using the Coursera teaching platform. He was one of the earliest 
instructors on Coursera and has been teaching since July 2012.
His courses focus on providing an "on-ramp" to students who want 
learn more about network and computing technology.
In this keynote, we will look at at the current trends 
in teaching and learning technology as well as look at technology and pedagogy 
behind the course, and behind Coursera in general. We will look at the data 
gathered for the course and talk about what worked well and what could be 
improved. We will also look at some potential long-term effects of 
the current MOOC movement.

<b>Sakai: Building an Open Source Community</b><br/>
This presentation describes the experiences of building the open-source 
Sakai teaching and learning environment and community from the inside.   
Sakai was founded by the University of Michigan,  Indiana University, 
Stanford University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
The Sakai project was funded by the  Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, 
The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and over 100 Sakai partner 
schools and companies for over five million dollars over a two year period.  
The project was very ambitious with an almost impossible schedule 
for delivery.  Almost nothing in the project went according to the 
plans and yet today, the Sakai software is in enterprise production 
use at nearly 300 schools world wide with three million daily users 
and a ten percent market share of top-100 universities worldwide.
This is the story of the successes and failures and challenges and
recoveries along the way as well as the laughter, joy and sadness as the
project went forward from the perspective of the chief architect and
later executive director.  The book "Sakai: Free as in Freedom (Alpha)"
describes this period of the Sakai effort.

<b>An Inside Look at the History of the Internet</b><br/>
This session looks at the history of the Internet and World-Wide-Web
paying particular  attention to some of the moments where it was not
assured that things were going to work out and produce the user
experience we have today. Via video interviews, we meet a number of the
innovators of the Internet and World-Wide-Web and focus on what might
have happened if things had not worked out the way they did. While much
of the research in Internet protocols and technologies was very
deliberate, until 1994 it was not clear that either the Internet nor the
World-Wide-Web had any purpose beyond connecting academics, scientists,
and computer scientists. In many ways, both the Internet and
World-Wide-Web were lab experiments that escaped into the wild. We look
at those moments where the lab experiments escaped and imagine possible
alternate realities if things had turned out differently.  </p>

<b>The University As A Cloud: Trends in Openness in Education</b><br/>
This talk and discussion will consist of three separate but related themes 
about the vision of strategic opportunities for higher education for the next 
20 years. The general view is that Universities need to apply the concept of 
"open" across their entire enterprise. This will result in the boundaries 
between the university and the world outside of the university becoming 
increasingly blurry. The move toward a more porous approach across the domain 
of higher education activity is necessary to maintain the relevance, value, and 
competitive advantages of institutions, as society becomes increasingly open 
and open. It is a trait that becomes "expected". We will examine opportunities 
for universities to accentuate their strengths and positive qualities in an era 
of openness. The specific topics will include: (1) trends in open technology 
applied to teaching learning and collaboration, (2) trends in moving toward 
technology literacy as a core part of the definition of a Liberal Arts 
education, and (3) trends in content creation and publishing that are beginning 
to revolutionize how we will create, publish, and curate the intellectual 
output of higher education. The format of the talk will be a short strategic 
position papers on each of three topics, a short "lightning talk" about each of 
the topics and an interactive discussion about each of the three topics.

<b>Clouds on the Horizon: Evolving Teaching, Learning and Technology in Higher Education</b><br/>
This presentation will examine the effects of emerging trends in Cloud 
Computing on the future of higher education. Cloud Computing is already 
transforming how we teach and learn, and will further redefine the 
relationships among Information Technology and other campus groups. We will 
explore how its initiatives can be embraced and leveraged to better serve those 
constituencies. Innovations and research in Cloud Computing are driven 
primarily by the commercial sector; higher education is therefore at risk of 
waiting too long to understand and fully exploit its benefits. We will take a 
long-term strategic overview of how higher education can partner with Cloud 
Computing to take a more active role in harnessing and shaping its future.

<b>IMS Learning Tools Interoperability: What's New and What's Next?</b><br/>
IMS Learning Tools Interoperability 1.0 now has very broad market
adoption.  Many learning management systems
have added LTI support to building blocks, making it very simple to add
LTI to a building block.   Developers can plug externally hosted
learning tools into their LMS with a
few lines of PHP.  Now that the low-level LTI "plumbing" is in place,
what will we do with it?   This talk looks at the tools that are
available in the marketplace that support IMS LTI and show them plugged
into various learning mnanagement systems.  
We will introduce and describe IMS Learning Tools
Interoperability 1.1 that includes support for returning grades from
external tools back to the grade book and demonstrate this.  This talk
also looks at ways to quickly build and host tools that function as LTI
Providers and plug those tools into their LMS.   This talk also looks
at the next release of IMS Learning Tools Interoperability 2.0 that
includes even simpler provisioning and installation of tools, expanded
grade/outcome services, and  improved ability to import and export
classes with links to dynamic content and services hosted on the web.
<p>
<b>Experiences Teaching a First Programming/Technology Course 
at the Graduate Level</b><br/>
The University of Michigan School of Information master's program has a
programming requirement (www.si502.com) for all students regardless of
whether their major is Human Computer Interaction, Social Computing, or
Library and Information Science.  With a typical enrollment of 70% women
and almost no prior programming technical experience for the typical
student, this class provides unique challenges in the design and
teaching of the course.   The course features a textbook specially
designed for the course (Python for Informatics: Exploring Information).
  The course is much broader than most first computing courses and
includes topics like database modeling, SQL, HMTL, CSS, XML parsing,
security, web scraping, internet architecture, and others in addition to
the programming component of the course.  The course moves back and
forth between programming and conceptual topics throughout the semester.
 One of the goals of the course is to empower and encourage students to
take additional technology courses such as web site design and
development.  The presentation will describe the course and describe the
results of the course to date.
<p>
<b>Workshop: Building Learning Tools using IMS Learning Tools 
Interoperability</b><br/>
The IMS Learning Tools Interoperability standard (www.imsglobal.org/lti)
greatly reduces the effort required to integrate an externally hosted
learning tool into nearly all of the mainstream learning management
systems (Blackboard, Desire2Learn, Moodle, Canvas, Sakai, OLAT, and
others).  IMS Learning Tools Interoperability uses the OAuth protocol to
send identity, course, user, and role data to the external tools.  
External tools can do roster transparent provisioning and single sign on
using LTI as well as return grades to the calling learning management
system.  LTI allows those who would build innovative tools for teaching
and learning an unprecedented simplicity in plugging their tool into any
number of different learning management systems.  This workshop will
introduce the standard as well as demonstrate freely available sample
code to simplify the building LTI compliant tools in PHP.   Participants
will develop and integrate a simple tool into Canvas, Sakai, Blackboard,
or Moodle as part of the workshop.

<b>Reopening Open - What is the Real Meaning of Open?</b><br/>
It has been over 20 years since the the Gnu Public License (GPL) and Berkeley 
Software Distribution (BSD) licenses were created. In the beginning, Open 
Source was a very radical notion and was seen as a way to foment a new social 
contract around software and later content. In this talk, we look at the 
motivation and context of the early open licenses and the software development 
communities that formed as an extension of the activist origins of the Open 
movement (i.e. the bazaar). We also look at the phase where the notion of Open 
has moved from radical-far-out to the mainstream as it became clear that these 
open bazaar-style communities actually had advantages over the more traditional 
styles of organization. We look at how the concept of "open" has been redefined 
away from its activist roots so that it can be applied to more traditional and 
even completely closed-source proprietary solutions. We also look at how the 
concept of open has moved into content through the Creative Commons and the 
kinds of new ways of working now that we have a reasonable structure for 
content reuse and remixing. In addition, we will look forward at the potential 
problems that "Open" must face going forward and look for a way for us to get 
back to the roots of open.

<b>Teaching Informatics to Everyone: The End of Dilbert</b><br/>
People will look at old Dilbert comics in 50 years and will no longer 
understand why they are funny. The word "nerd" will simply be a 
"funny arcane word" like the word "flapper". In this presentation 
we look past the time where technology was the domain of the elite 
few and instead technology skills become basic skills that all 
educated people must posses. We will look at how a completely new 
set of courses, curricula, books and teaching methods are needed 
to reach the point where we all possess necessary technology skills. 
Examples will be drawn from the new undergraduate Informatics 
program at the University of Michigan as well as the graduate 
programs in the School of Information.
<p>
The presentation will be a very out-of-the box look at how we 
need to take technology and move it into the mainstream so we 
need to revise the old saying to be "reading, writing, and 
technology". The examples and topics covered will range from 
the practical and pragmatic design of real courses, books and 
curricula to the more fanciful imaginary long-term transformation 
in education that I feel must and will take place over the next 50 years.

<b>Evolving Teaching and Learning: Beyond the LMS (Apple Academix)</b><br/>
The LMS market today faces a strange contradiction - few teachers truly *love* 
their current LMS but at the same time no one wants to endure the pain of 
switching to a new LMS.   The LMS vendors are slowly cloning each other's 
features and innovation is slowing.  At the same time how people teach and how 
people learn using technology is constantly changing and evolving.  Teachers 
continuously experiment with technologies outside of the LMS system with 
varying levels of success.  When teachers leave their LMS to teach they take 
full responsibility of the technology experience with varied results for both 
the teachers and students.  In a way we need to have our cake and eat it too.  
We want the security, stability, and common user interface of an enterprise LMS 
but with the ability to mix in tools and content from many sources including 
tools and content produced by teachers, groups of teachers, and from various 
publishers and repositories.   It seems that for the past few years, we have 
been waiting for a transformative approach that will improve what we can do 
with technology and teaching without losing the aspects of LMS systems that 
work well.  It is not a question of "will this transformation will happen?" - 
but only "when will the transformation happen"?  This talk will discuss some of 
the stresses and conflicts in the uses of the current LMS systems and talk 
about how we can gently evolve LMS systems into a whole new life form without 
upsetting the LMS ecosystem. The concept of placing LMS systems into content 
instead of placing content into LMS systems will be introduced and early 
research into the area will be shown and described.

<b>CloudSocial: A New Approach to Enabling Open Content for Broad Reuse</b><br/>
CloudSocial is a new approach to socially enhanced learning that allows 
learners to move among any web-based resources and have their learning 
environment and co-learners move with them. CloudSocial enables web-accessible 
learning content to be used by a wide variety of formal and informal learning 
environments without requiring the information to be copied into each of the 
learning environments. Instead, the learning systems integrate themselves into 
the content. This will allow dramatic increases in the accessibility, 
flexibility and interactivity of most all web content, but especially of open 
content, no matter what its format. It will thus be possible to integrate open 
content more easily into a wider variety of teaching and learning contexts and 
potentially increase the use and value of open content. CloudSocial enables the 
formation of informal learning cohorts who can work together to collaboratively 
learn a subject using content from a wide range of sources outside of, within, 
or alongside of current formal learning environments. Courses will add a "map" 
of Internet resources to access and use---as the learners move between web 
resources their chosen learning system will follow them. CloudSocial is not a 
"single LMS' - rather it is a set of extensible protocols and capabilities that 
allow any LMS to interact with the CloudSocial enabled content.  CloudSocial 
makes use of the IMS Learning Tools Interoperability protocol to integrate the 
learning systems into the content. CloudSocial is currently under development 
by the the University of Michigan Medical School and OpenMichigan project. 
CloudSocial is in its early stages of pre-alpha rollout.
