<h1>Research and Teaching Interests</h1>
<h3>Dr. Charles R. Severance</h3>
My research interests are an eclectic blend of information technology, 
computer science and educational technology.  
To me the ultimate goal of IT activity is to make
the world a better place for others.  To that end, I try to choose research areas
which have the potential for real impact int the real world.  
Nearly all of my research has resulted in some type of impact beyond 
the world of journal publications and grants.  I enjoy working "outside the box" 
exploring novel applications and uses of computing and technology and using novel
approaches to solving these problems.
<p>
My current research focus is in the development of standards to allow tools
and content to move freely from one learning management system to another.
This work is primarily funded through the IMS Global Learning Consortium
(www.imsglobal.org).  The IMS Learning Tools Interoperability and IMS Common 
Cartridge have been a focus of my effort in this area.    My work ranges from 
developing standards documents, developing certification tests, developing materials
for education and outreach, and providing expertise to people around the world who 
are adopting and using the specification.
<p>
I am also very interested in the "Informatics" movement and was one of the 
founding faculty members of the University of Michigan undergraduate Informatics
concentration in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA).  In this
program we focus on giving students the necessary and useful technical skills to 
augment their chosen career.   
The Social Computing track for the Informatics
concentration forms the basis of the new (in 2014) School of Information Bachelors
of Science in Information.
This program is dedicated to the notion
that while a small fraction of all college graduates will be full-time
professional programmers, having a solid understanding of technology is important
for nearly every college graduate.  I have written a a free and open book 
aimed specifically at teaching programming to non-programmers called 
"Python for Informatics: Exploring Information".  
<p>
In addition to research in educational technology,
my research interests include: cloud computing, high performance computing, 
scientific visualization, computer architecture, 
parallel processing, internet applications and networking.
I fundamentally believe that we will always have the need for computers
which are many times faster than our personal computers.  Regardless of
the capability of a single computer, we will continue to "lash" 
computers together to solve larger and more complicated problems.
These large scale computers are often difficult to use compared to 
personal computers.  This field is moving from finding ways ot increase the performance of computational tasks toward 
finding ways to build scalable web applications like Facebook and Twitter.
<p>
I have a broad interest in teaching.  I enjoy teaching advanced classes in 
my area of expertise to advanced students.  I also enjoy teaching the
very earliest classes where students begin to become aware of the
power of computing.  I look at teaching in two ways.  First, I teach to 
share my knowledge.  Second, I teach to learn.  We all must be life-long 
learners and when teaching is done well it makes the teacher a learner.  
To this end I would like to
teach classes outside my field of expertise as a learning experience.
Someday I imagine teaching classes in mathematics, physics, 
economics, and many other fields in addition to my computer 
and technology oriented classes.
<p>
I believe that research, teaching and outreach are inseparable.  Better research
leads to more useful instruction and by teaching, we create new researchers 
and research opportunities.  I feel that the best class is one where the 
student is given more questions than answers while also provided the tools 
to answer those questions. 
<p>
I also feel that it is important to share our skills and knowledge outside the
higher education community.  To this end I regularly give presentations to 
community groups on a wide variety of topics.  I try to use television and
radio to interact with an audience beyond the university.
I was a regular guest on the program
NewsTalk-870 aired on WKAR radio in Lansing Michigan..
I was also a co-host of an award-winning television show
Nuthin' but Net produced by MediaOne appearing monthly.
Before Nuthin but Net, I was a co-host of another
talk show about the Internet titled
Internet:TCI.  The show won
several national and regional awards during its lifetime.
