<h3>Producing a Lecture Using Sync-O-Matic 2000</h3>
This section describes how to produce a lecture using Sync-O-Matic 2000.
<P>
Most of the functionality of Sync-O-Matic is described in this section.  The following section documents the remaining features.

The main screen for Syncomat is a series of buttons which are enabled based on what you can possibly do next.
<P>
In this screen, the only buttons are <b>New Lecture</b> and <b>Open Lecture</b>.  The menu options <b>File | New Lecture</b> and <b>File | Open Lecture</b> do the same thing as these buttons.  In general, there is a menu option which corresponds to each button.  The menu options are enabled and disabled as you perform various tasks.
<P>
So, to continue with this tutorial, press <b>New Lecture</b>.

<!-- file:020newlecturesdir-->
Given that this is the first time you have executed the program, the directory
<b>C:\My Documents\lectures\</b> won't exist so you will be asked to create it.
<P>
If you are on NT or want to store all of your lectures somewhere else, feel free to say "No" to this prompt.  You will be able to put the lectures anywhere you want in the next dialog.
<P>
But in general, say <b>yes</b> to this to this prompt.

This is the standard directory selection dialog used throughout Sync-O-Matic.  Sometimes the
<b>New Dir</b> button is enabled and sometimes it is disabled when you are not expected to be creating directories.
<P>
In this case, we need a separate directory for each lecture. The convention we will use in this example is to make each lecture a subdirectory of <b>C:\My Documents\lectures\"</b>, so press <b>New Dir</b>.

Once the <b>New Lecture</b> process is complete, you will notice that the <b>Select PowerPoint</b> button has been enabled.  This pattern of new buttons becoming enabled as each step is successfully completed will continue throughout Syncomat.
<P>
Press <b>Select PowerPoint</b>.

This message appears because the PowerPoint file has four slides and the directory has no GIFs.  That is because we just created the empty directory.

<!-- file:090selectsizeandconvert-->
Now we have a newly enabled button to allow us to convert the PowerPoint file to a series of GIF images.
<P>
First, make sure to select the proper image size - 300x400 is a good choice. Then press the
<b>Convert PPT to GIFs</b>.

<!-- file:100convertedseeplus-->
The conversion will show its progress on the status bar at the bottom of the screen.  It should step through each slide, converting it to a GIF and finding the title of the slide.
<P>
Once it is complete the <b>Record Lecture</b> button will be enabled.  If you want, you can use the <b>+</b> and <b>-</b> buttons to look at thumbnails of the slides.
<P>
The next step in the tutorial is to record a lecture, so press the <b>Record Lecture</b> button.

This screen is essentially the RealProducer as built-into Syncomat.  Many of the buttons and controls are similar to RealProducer.  This is the point, where your testing of RealProducer, video and audio will pay off.  If your video or audio is improperly configured Syncomat cannot compensate at this screen.
<P>
If you have too much trouble with this screen, exit Syncomat and try to debug the audio and video using RealProducer and even the Sound Recorder application included with Windows.
<P>
First, check the bandwidth you want and whether or not you want video.  If you select video, additional controls will appear in the dialog.
<P>
For this tutorial, we use video, so enable the checkbox.

When the video options appear, you need to select the driver from the pick list and then press <b>Setup</b>.
<P>
You may need to figure out the proper driver using some trial and error.  In general, avoid the "WDM" drivers as your first try.
<P>
If things don't work, you may even have to exit Syncomat and restart.
<P>
Once the right drivers are selected, press <b>Setup</b>.  Now all of the device drivers are initialized - this process might take 30 seconds to complete.

<!-- file:130setupcompletepresssource-->
After setup completes, the most important thing is to see the preview video on the left screen.  If the preview video is not there, you may have your camera/capture card installed improperly or have chosen the wrong driver.
<P>
Three new buttons are also now available.  These buttons allow you to adjust the video settings, using them you may or may not be able to fix non-working video.
<P>
Each of these dialogs is different based on the camera or video capture device.
<P>
We will look at each in turn.
<P>
To adjust audio, use the volume control icon in the system tray.  See the
<a href=../030installrealproducer/index.htm>Installing and Testing RealProducer</a> documentation for details on properly setting the audio levels.

<b>Video Source</b> generally deals with adjustments available on the camera and if the capture hardware has multiple sources (S-Video or composite) you can select them here.  Often if you see an all-blue or all-black screen and you are using a video capture card (not a camera) the
problem is with the source.

Often video capture device drivers have the ability to compress data inside the device driver.  Because Real has its own (very slick and sophisticated) compression, if Real is given compressed data, it must uncompress the data and then recompress the data again.  This causes a significant performance penalty and a significant loss of quality.  So don't use any form of compression.
<P>
Some drivers cannot provide uncompressed data (ATI All-In-Wonder Pro).  It is not the end of the world, but it is a good reason to buy a WinTV capture card instead.

Once things are setup, you can press <b>Next</b>.   While you are recording your lecture this screen will still be visible but not moveable, so before you press <b>Next</b>, make sure to move the screen where you want it.
<P>
In general is it <i>not</i> necessary to use the <b>Source</b>, <b>Format</b>, or <b>Compression</b> buttons.  Usually the defaults are just fine.

Now you are recording.  Press the <b>+</b> key to advance to the next slide as necessary.

Syncomat will produce a directory full of files with a web lecture suitable for play off the local disk.  The naming convention is to create a subdirectory called <b>synccd</b> as a subdirectory of the main lecture directory.
<P>
This naming convention can be altered in <b>Options | Preferences</b>.

In this tutorial, we just accept the default and press <b>Yes</b>.

The files will be stored in the local directory on the hard disk for uploading to the web.  The convention in general is to create a subdirectory called <b>syncweb</b> within the lecture directory.
<P>
It is possible to store this material in any directory.  It is even possible to use a network mounted drive to put the files directly on the server as part of the publish process.  The default convention is determined in <b>Option | Preferences</b>.
