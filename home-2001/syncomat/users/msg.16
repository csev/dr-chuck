ClipBoard-2000 Newsletter: Number 1

Well, the Alpha Test of ClipBoard-2000 has begun.

If you missed the last message, ClipBoard-2000 is a Mac-based tool
which merges, audio, video, drawing, text and other information to 
make a QuickTime lecture with annotation which can be streamed over
the web.

You must use a Mac to produce the lectures but the movies can be 
played back on a PC or Mac.

Take a look at the sample lecture, download the software, test it 
out and let me know what happens (good or bad).

And Yes - it will someday run on a PC - it is designed to be ported with a
minimum of effort - but my first priority is to make the software more 
robust.  I may even get some help on the PC port.

I would like to thank Apple Computer Corporation for their help and support 
on this project - they were the ones who made this happen so quickly.

P.S.  I will soon separate the mailing lists - first I need to build a 
registration mechanism for ClipBoard-2000.  Bear with me for a few 
weeks until I get things sorted out.
