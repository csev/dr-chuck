<h3>Installing Sync-O-Matic 2000</h3>
This section describes how to install Sync-O-Matic 2000.  Make sure to get the
most up-to-date version from
<a href=http://www.netfact.com/syncomat/>http://www.netfact.com/syncomat/</a>
before starting.  It is assumed that you have downloaded the file and properly
registered to get the password needed later in the process.

Once you have downloaded the installation file, it needs to be unzipped.
<P>
WinZip is a perennial favorite in this area so it will be used for this example.
<P>
Press <b>Extract</b>.

The contents of the .zip file are an install package.  There is a <b>setup.exe</b> and a bunch of files.  In this example, we will extract to
<b>C:\Temp\sync2k\</b>.

Once the files are extracted, navigate to the directory and execute <b>setup.exe</b>.
<P>
If you are running on NT make sure that you are an Administrator.  This process will install and register lots of stuff, so without Administrator permission, it is pointless to proceed.  On Windows-95 and Windows-98 everyone is an administrator, so it is much simpler :).

Setup initially puts up a screen (white background with blue test) as several files needed for the setup process are installed.  You may actually have to reboot at this time and when the system reboots re-run startup.
<P>
This reboot at this point should only happen once, and generally it won't happen again even if you remove and reinstall Sync-O-Matic or other packages developed in Visual Basic 5.0.

Syncomat has no control over the look of this screen.  The trick is to click on the great big picture in the center, rather than looking all over for the <b>Next</b> button that does not exist.

This restart will happen each time you install the product. - Might as well get it over with :).

Usually the installation goes smoothly unless NT is involved or your organization has an official supported configuration.
<P>
If you are having trouble, try it on a Windows-98 machine rather than NT.  Sync-O-Matic works fine on NT, it is just the "corporate environments" invented for your own "safety"
that get in the way.
<P>
Happy Sync-O-Matting....
