As a packet moves out from the source application to its network connection, headers are added at each layer.  The TCP layer adds a header, and the IP layer adds a layer.  To put the packet out on the Ethernet, the network access layer adds a header.  In our one-hop Internet, a router connects the Ethernet segment to a FDDI (Fiber optic) segment.  As the router copies the data off the Ethernet, the Ethernet header is processed and discarded leaving only the TCP and IP headers.  When the data is put out onto the FDDI, the network access layer adds a FDDI header around the TCP, IP and data areas of the packets.
<BR></UL><UL>
In the destination system, as the layers process ithe incoming data, the various headers are peeled off and discarded.  As the packet is copied into the system, the physical FDDI header is processed and discarded.  At the IP layer, the packet is checked to see if it is actually in the proper system.  Then the IP header is discarded and the remaining packet is sent to the TCP layer.  The TCP layer checks to see that the data is in-order and returns the acknowlegement to the sending system.  Then the TCP header is discarded and the data is sent to the destination application.
</UL><UL>
As packet crosses many hops, it will have many different physical headers.  However the TCP and IP headers remain with the packet across all the hops.</UL> </P>
