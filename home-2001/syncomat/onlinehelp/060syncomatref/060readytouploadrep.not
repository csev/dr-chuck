Once a lecture has been recorded, you can either publish it to the hard disk or to the web.

Another option is to upload the raw materials necessary to publish the lecture to some type of repository.

In some ultimate future, repositories will exist which can automatically "publish" Sync-O-Matic lectures, but in the short term, typically some human "Lecture-master" will be doing the publish process for these lectures uploaded to a "repository".
