<h1>Changes in This version</h1>
Sync-O-Matic 2000 Version Beta-2
<p>
Small fixes relating to playing media from FlipIT.  This release is a joint production 
of Skip and I.  Skip kept testing until we found the answer.
<ul>
<li>
Fixed the FlipIT unable to play problem.
<li>
Went through the open process in More Detail making sure that the preferences were
updated so you come back to the lecture you were last working on.
<li>
Added a bunch of slick features to the Test | RealPlay screen.   It is now a much better test (and will give 
much better feed back than in previous releases.
<p>
<li>Make Streaming the default on More Details when the rtsp preference has been set to anything other
than the default.
<li>
Made the default start directory C:\My Documents\lectures\test\ instead of C:\My Documents\lectures.
</ul>
