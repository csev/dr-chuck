Wow - my server went down because of a routing problem.  Got it back up tonight.
Version 1.14 is up.  A few changes:

-  Just use RealProducer 7.0 with Sync-O-Matic after version 1.17
-  The PC version of RealProducer does not handle Quicktime too well
   Sync-O-Matic detects this and suggests using the Mac RealProducer
   manually to convert ClipBoard/Quicktime to Real
-  I tried to make Import work with PPT-2000
-  I completely re-did the FTP interface and fixed some bugs
-  There is a little "test" menu for some of the modules - I will remove
   it in a later release - but it might help diagnose a problem
-  Spent some time giving better error messages based on user feedback
-  Fixed some NASTY little bugs on "make lecture for the web" introduced 
   in 1.12
