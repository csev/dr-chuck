Using Linear Hashing on a Multiprocessor System."  
</a>

<p>
PhD. Michigan State University - Graduated 1996 - 
Major Computer Science - Advisor 
Dr. Richard Enbody
Topic: 
<a href=http://www.netfact.com/crs/papers/thesis/>
Managing the Overall Balance of Operating System Threads 
on a Multiprocessor Using Automatic Self-Adjusting Threads (ASAT)
</a>
This thesis has been adapted into several commercial compilers and 
is now part of the standard for thread based parallelism
(<a href=http://www.openmp.org/>www.openmp.org</a>) 
supported by nearly all shared-memory parallel processor vendors.
<h2>Media Activities</h2>
<p>
I am a regular guest on the program
<a href=http://www.wkar.org/radio/listarch.htm#jensen>
NewsTalk-870</a>
with Steven Jensen aired on WKAR radio.  
I appear with Rich Wiggins and the topic is Internet and Technology.  
<p>
I am one of the co-hosts of an award-winning television show
<a href=http://www.netfact.com/nbn/>
Nuthin' but Net</a>.
This show is produced by MediaOne and appears monthly.  
Richard Wiggins is the co-host of the program.
<p>
Before Nuthin but Net, Richard Wiggins and I were the hosts of another
talk show about the Internet titled
<a href=http://www.netfact.com/tci/>
Internet:TCI</a>.
This show was produced by TCI North Central Region.  The show won
several national and regional awards during its lifetime.
<p>
<h2>Software Developed:</h2>
<p>
I developed a tool called Sync-O-Matic 3000 which automates the production
of web-lectures using RealNetworks media and HTML.  This product is in use 
at a number of sites around the world and is downloaded several times 
each week.  The best example of its use is the CERN Web lecture repository 
<a href=http://webcast.cern.ch/Projects/WebLectureArchive/>
http://webcast.cern.ch/Projects/WebLectureArchive/</a>.
<p>
To address some of the difficulties in using Sync-O-Matic, 
I developed a tool called ClipBoard-2000 which also produces web-based
lectures using Quicktime.  ClipBoard-2000 is very easy to use and it 
allows the instructor to annotate their slides with text and drawing.
ClipBoard also allows the instructors to use a document camera to show
objects.
ClipBoard is early in the development process but has generated significant
interest from both commercial and educational institutions.  
See 
<a href=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~csev/projects/cb2k/>

for more details 
and sample media.
<p>
<h2>Books and Chapters:</h2>
<p>
I am the author for the second edition of
"High Performance Computing", published by O'Reilly and Associates.
The book was published in 1998.  It is designed to be used to teach
HPC to programmers of many fields ranging from chemistry to computer science.
It has been used around the country in a number of undergraduate HPC 
courses.
<p>
Since 1995 I have been the editor of the Standards Column of 
the IEEE Computer magazine.  I have written 15 columns and edited 
the remaining columns.  Selected Columns: 
January 1999 - POSIX: A Model for the Future of Computing,
July 1998 - Standardizing Real-Time Streaming Protocols,
March 1998 - IEEE 754: An Interview with William Kahan,
September 1997 - OSI Retrospect and Prospect, and 
February 1997 - Linking Computers and Consumer Electronics.
<p>
I wrote a chapter on "Distributed File Systems" in the book
The Internet for Everyone: A Guide for Users
and Providers written by Richard Wiggins available from McGraw-Hill.
<p>
I participated in the development of
IEEE Standard POSIX P1003.0: 
Guide to the POSIX Open System Environment.
I was a member of P1003.0 Working Group from January 1990 through
July 1995.
I was the primary author for the following sections: Introduction,
(4.2) Network Services, and (4.11) Application Development Support Services.
This document is about to be approved as an international
ISO technical report TR-14292.
I was also the vice-chair for the POSIX 1003 committee from 1993-1996.
