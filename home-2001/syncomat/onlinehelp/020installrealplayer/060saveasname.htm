At this dialog, navigate to a directory to save the materials.
<P>
Some people create a special directory to save these files.  If, for example, you upgrade your browser, you may have to uninstall and reinstall your RealPlayer to have it work properly.  So why re-download it time and time again.
<P>
One reasonable place to store these files is
<b>C:\My Documents\KeepZips\Real\</b> or some other place you will remember.
