The data transmitted over the Internet is in the form of “packets” each packet is separately addressed and can take any path through the network. Packets may arrive out of order or not at all. The primary advantage of packets is that an idle system sends no packets and does not take any of the network resources. 
<BR></UL><UL>
     Of course the local phone connection is still taking resources from the phone company.   One the national links, millions of packets are sent on the same link.   The idea of the Internet is to lease on expensive phone line and have potentially thousands of users transmitting data over the leased line at the same time.   The net result is that real-time information such as Internet Phone works very well across the Internet unless there is a great deal of traffic in which case Internet phone will experience skips and pauses.</UL> </P>
