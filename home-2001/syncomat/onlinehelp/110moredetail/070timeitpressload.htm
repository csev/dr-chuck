This is the main screen for <b>TimeIT</b>.  TimeIT views and edits events files such as <b>rawmedia.txt</b>.  Unfortunately, TimeIT cannot edit files produced by <b>ClipBoard-2000</b> or the <b>Liberal Slide Names</b> mode of Sync-O-Matic.  If you try to load this type of file - typically called <b>images.txt</b> - TimeIT will complain.
<P>
Across the top, there are buttons to <b>Load</b> a file, <b>Reset</b> the data, <b>Save</b> a file, and
<b>Exit</b> TimeIT.
<P>
TimeIT is a time-oriented spreadsheet.  At the bottom are the rows and columns of the spreadsheet.  The left column is the slide name - this either should be in the form of <b>sld000.htm</b> where "000" is replaced by the slide number or an absolute URL.  The second column is the start time of the slide and the third column is the end time of the slide.  One particular row in the second column will be green to indicate which row is being edited.  The first column will be red when TimeIT is concerned about the data in the row.  This can be a missing start or end time, or a start time which is after an end time.
<P>
On the last row, the end time is the overall clip time.  Before saving the file, no red should be showing.
<P>
The <b>Add</b> button creates a blank row below the current row.  The <b>Insert</b> button creates a new row above the current row.  The <b>Delete</b> button deletes the current row.
<P>
To edit the contents of the row, select the row by clicking on the center column in the row you want to edit.  It should become green and the values from the row should appear in the fields just above the grid.  The values can be edited in the two fields above the first and second columns.  The <b>Media Length</b> time can be entered in the field above the third column.  This is the ending time of the last slide in the presentation.
<P>
<P>
The only other field is the "Auto-Matic Slide-Timing Adjustment Tool".  With this tool, you can add or subtract a fixed amount of time from all of the slide starting times.  You enter the amount of time to adjust and then press either the <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> key.
<P>
This is generally used in two ways.  First, if there was some mismatch between the time the slide timing was started and the media play or record was started, a few seconds can be trimmed or added.  Second if you are reading time codes or some other time information which does not start at zero, you can enter all of the times directly into TimeIT and then when done subtract the "zero" time from all of the starting times.
<P>
TimeIT is one of the features which is heavily used by the more sophisticated users of Sync-O-matic, such as those environments where Sync-O-Matic is used in a recording studio.
