The numeric addresses assigned to each computer contain “geographical” information, much like a zip     code. For example, zip codes starting with “0” such as 09876 are on the East Coast in the US, while zip     codes such as 96552 are on the west cost and zip codes like 48824 are in the middle of the country.

In the above address, the 35 means somewhere in the state of Michigan and the 8 means a particular   network segment at Michigan State University. The .2.41 portion of the address can also include some    “routing” information

Because these addresses depend in where the computer is physically located, they may need to be changed periodically as computers are moved about. Because of this it is a bad practice to use these numeric addresses. however they work just as well as the text style addresses such as scully.egr.msu.edu. The net is beginning to run out of system numbers. There is an effort called IP Next Generation which you can take a look at <a href=http://playground.sun.com/pub/ipng/html/ipng-main.html>http://playground.sun.com/pub/ipng/html/ipng-main.html</a>

With IP-Next Generation we can have up to 2128 Computers on the net!</UL> </P>
