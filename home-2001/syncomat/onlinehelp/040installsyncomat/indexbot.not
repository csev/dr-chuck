Usually the installation goes smoothly unless NT is involved or your organization has an official supported configuration.

If you are having trouble, try it on a Windows-98 machine rather than NT.  Sync-O-Matic works fine on NT, it is just the "corporate environments" invented for your own "safety" 
that get in the way.

Happy Sync-O-Matting....
