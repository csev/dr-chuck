Sync-O-Matic Newsletter-25

Hello all.  Version Alpha 6 is out with some major cleanup and new 
features.  Alpha 5 was out - but even before I announced it, Deborah 
found that I had reintroduced a bug so I had to come out with 
version A6.

Take a look at the "What's new" section in the download page.  There 
was lots of cleanup, and a few new features as well.

The new style (sy2k) now can deal with video of varying sizes and 
I added a feature to allow users to sync naturally to pre-digitized 
Real Media (Furio's request pushed me over the top on this one).  
But check the what's new for all of the gory details.

Originally I thought that A3 was the "almost Beta" version of 
the code.  But several users told me not to remove all of the 
"old" features from -3000 - so this A4 through A6 rethought 
how to keep nearly all of the old capabilities in the 
"More Detail" mode.

But of course, then I have to document all of the new and 
powerful features in the "More detail" mode.

But with all of that said, I think that A6 is the "nearly Beta" 
version of the code.  Unless I hear lots of feedback about the 
user interface, my focus will shift to bug-fixing and writing 
documentation.  So I would much appreciate it if you could 
upgrade to A6, and make sure nothing is broken.  I will be 
doing my own testing in the next week or so as well.

Just for fun I put up the lectures from my entire 3 Credit course
which I taught using Sync-O-matic from 1997-1999 at Michigan State 
University.  Let me know what you think.
