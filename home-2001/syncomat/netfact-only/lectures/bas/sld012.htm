There is a large number of possible ways to use AltaVista.  More detail is available by pressing help at altavista.digital.com.  You can also do advanced searches which use Boolean expressions AND, OR, and NOT along with date ranges.  Your search expressions can use parenthesis.  You can also separate the search criterion from the ranking criterion.
<BR></UL><UL>
kayak AND "San Juan Islands" 
</UL><UL>
The operator AND ensures that both are present in the resulting documents. The operator AND binds less tightly than juxtaposition. 
</UL><UL>
"Digital Equipment Corporation" OR DEC 
</UL><UL>
The operator OR ensures that at least one is present in the resulting documents. The operator OR binds less tightly than the operator AND. 
</UL><UL>
Louis NEAR Monier 
</UL><UL>
The operator NEAR ensures that both are within ten words of each other in the resulting documents. The operator NEAR binds less tightly than the operator NOT and associates to the left. This query matches Louis Monier, Louis M. Monier and Monier, Louis. 
</UL><UL>
vegetable AND NOT "brussel sprouts" 
</UL><UL>
The operator NOT is used to exclude words or phrases from a query. The operator NOT binds less tightly than the operator OR . This query is equivalent to vegetable and (not  "brussel sprouts"). Do not use vegetable NOT "brussel sprouts"; this query is syntactically illegal.
