Sync-O-Matic detects the presence of the <b>rawmedia.mov</b> file without a <b>rawmedia.rm</b> file so it decides to let us encode the file using RealEncoder.  Press <b>Start</b> to begin the encoding process.  The progress bar at the bottom of the screen indicates how much work remains to be done.
<p>
Sadly, this is where the Windows RealProducer often fails to be able to encode many of the Quicktime media types.  Sometimes RealProducer even hangs completely at this point.
<p>
If you experience strange problems, first try to encode manually using the RealProducer from the <b>rawmedia.mov</b> to the <b>rawmedia.rm</b>.  Usually if the Sync-O-Matic encode fails the manual encode will fail in the same way.
<p>
The typical solution is to use RealProducer on the Macintosh which is capable of handling all types of Macintosh Quicktime files.  We will see an example of this in a moment.
