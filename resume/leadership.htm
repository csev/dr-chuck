<h1>Leadership Philosophy</h1>
<h3>Dr. Charles R. Severance</h3>
Throughout my career, I have enjoyed a wide range of positions from
individual contributor to director where my primary contribution was
leadership. My career approach has not been simply to climb upwards to
higher and higher positions. I find that moving into and out of
leadership / administrative roles is a way to make sure that I am always
challenging myself and learning from each new opportunity.
<p>
Because I have moved into and out of leadership positions throughout my
career, I have come to the point where I see leadership as simply one
more necessary resource for any organization. It is important for an
organization to see its leaders as important parts of a team rather than
some special creatures that inhabit the corner offices, board rooms,
airports, hotels, and taxis.
<p>
A leader's primary responsibility is to meet the goals and objectives of
the organization through taking care of and improving the efficiency of
the management and employees of that organization. A leader only rarely
gives orders - when a leader must resort to giving orders to get
something done, it indicates that something is out of balance in the
organization and when people are forced to do something they do not want
to do, it often incurs a future cost to the organization.
<p>
Even when a leader involves the organziation broadly in information gathering 
and decision making, they still retain the responsibility for both the successes
and the failures of the organization.  A true leader does not look for anyone 
to blame other than themselves when things do not work out as planned.
<p>
While my leadership philosophy is my own, there are several books that
nicely capture my leadership style.
<p>
<b>The Wisdom of Crowds, James Surowecki</b>
<p>
This book is a nearly perfect summary of my leadership style. The
essence of the book is that properly constructed groups are far wiser
than hand-selected "experts". The essence of a well-functioning
organization is open communication, permission to disagree, willingness
to hear and encourage alternate viewpoints, and a search for the real
truth rather than doggedly making top-down decisions following the
management hierarchy and chasing experts. I am fond of saying that an
organization functions best when its "chief architect" or "leader" is
not the most brilliant person in the organization and is aware of that
fact. It ensures that other members of the team can truly challenge the
leader's thinking and decisions in a constructive way and that the
leader does not go too far astray in their thinking.
<p>
<b>The Starfish and the Spider - The Power of Leaderless Organizations, 
Ori Brafman and Rod A Beckstrom</b>
<p>
This book looks at how an organization that allows diffuse leadership
and diffuse decision making (i.e., the Starfish) is far more resilient
to problems, challenges, and opportunities than an organization with a
strict, central top-down control (i.e., the Spider). You can kill a
spider with a single tiny pinprick to the right location. However, you
can cut a starfish in half and both parts will heal and regrow to become
complete starfish. The more power held tightly in a corner office, the
more likely that the organization will fail because of a single small
mistake or omission. Again, the conclusion from this book is that an
informed leader must do all they can to distribute decision making,
command, and control away from themselves.
<p>
There are, indeed, times where an organization needs to react in a
consistent and unified manner and in these situations a strong leader is
necessary. But for normal activities, a leader must develop other
members of the organization to take on essential roles, mentor them, and
support them as they learn new leadership skills. A leader should always
be willing to let go of responsibilities when others in the organization
are capable of handling leadership tasks. Delegation, development, and
mentoring allow a leader to have some "spare" resources available to be
ready to react quickly when new organizational opportunities arise.
<p>
<b>Summary</b>
<p>
The core of my leadership style is that the power one has and/or gains
in a leadership position is the least significant part of the job. The
most important part is to understand the purpose and goals of that
organization and develop a high-functioning team that can accomplish
those goals. If a leader is doing their job well, the organization will
become increasingly effective over time and find themselves expanding
into new opportunities because of this performance.
<p>
While it is important for a leader to do the things that make the
"trains run on time", simple management of operations is not the primary
purpose of a real leader. A real leader finds ways to make sure that the
operations within an organization run effectively, but this is often
done by delegating operational responsibility to others.
<p>
At times, a leader must make small and large decisions and it is
essential that a leader always have a plan - even if that plan is
evolving when new situations and information are encountered. Sometimes
an organization simply needs a decision to be made one way or another so
it can move forward. At those times, a true leader will understand the
nature of the team and organization well enough or be wise enough to
consult the crowd - to make the right choice most of the time.
<p>
At times the role of leadership is to step in and be a calming and
unifying force.
<p>
A well-run organization is continuously expanding and attracting new
resources and tasks because it is clear that resources will be used
effectively. A well-run organization is calm and confident, and its
members feel like they are part of a team. A well-run organization is
always looking for new and interesting challenges to expand its impact.
