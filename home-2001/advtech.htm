<h3>Advanced Technologies</h3>

The Advanced Technologies group supports the unique facilities in the Media Union.  The effort of the group falls into roughly three basic areas:
<ul>
<li>
Computing technologies supports the computing facilities throughout the building in cooperation with the Computer Assisted Network for Engineering (CAEN) and the Center for Parallel Computing (CPC).
<li>
Media technologies supports the studios (video, audio, and electronic music) and the other media equipment in the building.
<li>
Advanced software development is another effort to develop prototype software solutions to explore emerging media and computing technologies.
The Advanced Technologies staff also supports and participates various multimedia events throughout the building.
</ul>
Generally the advanced technologies group is not the first point of contact for end-users - generally requests for assistance and the use of facilities come in through the Faculty Studio or Programs office.

<h3>Facilities</h3>

The Media Union houses a number of innovative facilities available to the campus community supported by the Advanced Technologies group including:
<ul>
<li>Training rooms with 48 PC computers and 48 Macintosh computers
<li>Conference rooms andteleconferencing facilities
<li>Groundworks - A student-oriented computing and multimedia lab
<li> Experimental Classroom - A small reconfigurable instructional space with computers on carts and electronic music equipment
<li>Video Studio - Used for various multimedia productions
<li>Audio Studio - For recording and mixing up to 40 channnel audio projects
<li>Electronic Music Studio - For composing, performing, and mixing electronic music projects
<li>Virtual Reality Lab - Instructional and lab space for virtual reality courses and projects
<li>CAVE - Advanced, immersive virtual reality space
<li>Video Editing suites - providing access to faculty, staff, and students to AVID non-linear editing systems for professional quality video editing
</ul>
The overall goal of all of these facilities is to enhance the instructional and research efforts going on at the University of Michigan.  The facilities can be used by making researvations.  When a resource is needed at the same time by several activities, priority is given to those efforts which make the best use of the facilities and which will have the greatest impact on research and instruction. 
<p>
Often users of a complex facility will need to attend some trainingand/or write a short proposal before they are given full access to the facility.  There may be a cost to use some of the facilities (typically video studio)  if Media Union personnel need to be present for safety or other purposes.

<h3>Computing Support</h3>

The Advanced Technology group provides the technical support for the unique computing resources in the building.  This is done in cooperation with the Computer Assisted Engineering Network (CAEN) and the Center for Parallel Computing (CPC) groups.  CAEN provides the basic network infrastructure for the building and suports the public computing sites in the building.  the Center for Parallel Computing operates the supercomputer resources in the Media Union machine room on the first floor.  The Advanced Technology group interacts with these two groups and provides the technical support for the remaining computing equipment in the building such as the training rooms, video editing suites, virtual reality lab, CAVE, GroundWorks, teleconference facility, experimental classroom, and others.

<h3>Events</h3>

With the coordination of the programs office, the Advanced technology staff are often involved in the planning and production of events with Media Union involvement.  Example events include:
<ul>
<li>Support for small conferences held in the Media Union
<li>Support for multimedia performances in the video studio and elsewhere
</ul>
These events are an excellent way to showcase the excellent work being done by University of Michigan faculty, staff, and students at the Media Union.

<h3>Advanced Technology Development</h3>

Part of deploying and supporting technology involves looking ahead to anticipate how new technologies will fit into the current environment.  The group regularly procures and evaluates new technologies for potential future deployment in the Media Union and possibly across the campus.  Some example projects of this type include:
<ul>
<li>evaluation of wireless networking technology
<li>participation in Internet2 activities
<li>evaluation of high speed streaming video across existing network infrastructure
<li>web-based lecture capture and delivery
<li>evaluation of FireWire and Digital Video technology
</ul>
These efforts are pursued as time and resources are available.  This "skunkworks" activity is viewed as an essential element necesssary to keep the best possible technology available to the campus community and the Media Union.
