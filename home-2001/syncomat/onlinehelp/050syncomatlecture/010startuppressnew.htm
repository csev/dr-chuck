The main screen for Syncomat is a series of buttons which are enabled based on what you can possibly do next.
<P>
In this screen, the only buttons are <b>New Lecture</b> and <b>Open Lecture</b>.  The menu options <b>File | New Lecture</b> and <b>File | Open Lecture</b> do the same thing as these buttons.  In general, there is a menu option which corresponds to each button.  The menu options are enabled and disabled as you perform various tasks.
<P>
So, to continue with this tutorial, press <b>New Lecture</b>.
