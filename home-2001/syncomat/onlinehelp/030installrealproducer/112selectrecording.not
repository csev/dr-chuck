<h3>Audio Settings</h3>

Usually, getting the audio right is harder than the video.  Go to  <b> Options | Audio Capture Settings | Volume Control</b>.  This will bring up the volume control (same as clicking on the little speaker in the system tray in the lower right hand corner).

Inside the volume control, go to 
<b>Options | Properties</b> then select 
<b>Recording</b> and press <b>OK</b>.
