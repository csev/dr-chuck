<h1>Changes in This version</h1>
Sync-O-Matic 2000 Version Alpha-4
<ul>
<li>This release added a registration capability - there is no longer a need for a password
on the ZIP file.
<li>The multipart lectures are not deprecated any more thanks to comments by several users
<li>Advanced mode is gone - Now there is "More Details" - The main -2000 mode will not ask you things like streaming, etc.
<li>As of this release, Sync-O-Matic 3000 is no longer tracking release for release with 
Sync-O-Matic-2000.  The last remaining vestiges of -3000 are the "More Details" mode
in -2000.  It is a more detailed view of the -2000 options and data values.  
The code has forked into two versions with -3000 frozen in time.  I CAN
fix obvious bugs in -3000 - but it will take separate effort.
<li>Test mode has been moved into "More Detail"
<li>FlipIT! has been reworked to be more of a -2000 like thing.  You can now Flip slides
without running the encoder at all using FipIT!  Also you can make multipart lectures with FlipIT! (Yay)
<li>The ClipBoard Import function is no longer automatically invoked when you do Make Lecture - it is a manual operation that is available in More Details.
<li>More Details can be used to separate the media, copy, and htm_sld directories like the old -3000 directory layout but the default layout is -2000 like.
<li>I added a menu option called "Liberal Slide Names" which enables slides to be any .gif or .jpg file sequence.  In the last version this always happened - which confused some situations - so I made it something you have to select.
</ul>
<h3>To Do</h3>
This release is (still) closing in on the Beta-1 version - but since there was so much new development, things need to calm down again.
<ul>
<li>Add a way to access registration info in a style
<li>Get the upload host name from the URL (Duh!!!)
<li>More styles - the Andrew styles and the SMIL style
<li>Testing testing testing
<li> Way out: Add AVI capture, add AVI Import for ClipBoard-2000 PC, Think about Sync-O-Matic-1000 :)
</ul>
