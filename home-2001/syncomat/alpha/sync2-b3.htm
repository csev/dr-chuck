Sync-O-Matic 2000 Version Beta-3
<p>
Small fixes.
<ul>
<li>
Wow - Windows-95 installs failed because of an extra slash  - Thanks to Bob for hanging 
in there whe it seemed as though his computer was haunted.  This has been fixed.
<li>
Fixed a VERY old bug causing publication of a single slide lecture to fail.  It was a classic logic error - duh!
</ul>
