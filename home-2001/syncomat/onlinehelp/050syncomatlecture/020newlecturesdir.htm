Given that this is the first time you have executed the program, the directory
<b>C:\My Documents\lectures\</b> won't exist so you will be asked to create it.
<P>
If you are on NT or want to store all of your lectures somewhere else, feel free to say "No" to this prompt.  You will be able to put the lectures anywhere you want in the next dialog.
