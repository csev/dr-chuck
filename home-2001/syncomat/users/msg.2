Hello, this is my mailing list for the lecture making program
Sync-O-Matic 3000.  

You might be interested in another lecture using this format - Dr.
Robert Chiodo of University of Wisconsin Stout has made a really nice
lecture titled "Cost Rollup".

This is a hand-maintained list - just reply if you want to get dropped.
