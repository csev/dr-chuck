When the video options appear, you need to select the driver from the pick list and then press <b>Setup</b>.

You may need to figure out the proper driver using some trial and error.  In general, avoid the "WDM" drivers as your first try.

If things don't work, you may even have to exit Syncomat and restart.

Once the right drivers are selected, press <b>Setup</b>.  Now all of the device drivers are initialized - this process might take 30 seconds to complete.
