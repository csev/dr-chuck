Sometimes, instead of hanging, the RealProducer may complain with a message similar to this.  Again, the solution typically is to switch to the Macintosh RealProducer.

If the encode is successful (no error messages), the next step is to publish the lecture normally.  But for now, we assume the worst case and jump back to the Macintosh
to use RealProducer.
