Hello, this is my mailing list for teh lecture making program
Sync-O-Matic 3000.  I have survived my beta testers enough that I am
half-comfortable sending it out.  Extensive documentation will be a few
more weeks away so you might have to ask a question or two via E-Mail.

The project page is:

http://www.egr.msu.edu/~crs/projects/syncomat/

I have reorganized the page to make things simpler.  One of the coolest
things is a like to Ed Jones page where is testing out his own lecture.
Ed was the beta tester.

There are installation instructions, a FAQ, and some weak documentation.

The password for the ZIP files is bob

This is a hand-maintained list - just reply if you want to get dropped.
