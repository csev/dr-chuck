<H3> Solving Problems with Viewing the lecture</H3>
This page is designed to help you with problems while viewing the lectures. 
Typically the only problem with viewing from a CD-ROM or local disk is getting 
the proper version of the RealPlayer installed.
You should install the Realplayer available at no charge
from <a href=http://www.real.com/products/player/ target=_top>
www.real.com/products/player/</a>.  If you have problems with the G2 Beta 
player you may want to try the version 5 player.
