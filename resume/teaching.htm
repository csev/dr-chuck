<h1>Teaching Activity</h1>
<h3>Dr. Charles R. Severance</h3>
<hr>
<p>
I have taught at three different institutions at the college level: 
Lansing Community College, Michigan State University, and 
University of Michigan.
I love to teach - I am at my happiest (and busiest) when I am teaching.

<h2>Coursera</h2>
<p>
I teach a popular course on Coursera titled 
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/insidetheinternet" target="_blank">
Internet History, Technology, and Security</a>.  This is a Massive, Open enrollment
Online Course (MOOC) hosted by <a href="http://www.coursera.org" target="_blank">Coursera</a>.
</p>
<p>
I also teach a spcialization on Coursera titled 
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/pythonlearn" target="_blank">

<a href="http://www.py4e.com" target="_blank">licensed course materials</a>.  
</p>
<h2>Open Educational Resources </h2>
<p>
I am a strong supporter of the Open Educational Resources (OER) movement
and participate in the Open.Michigan 
(<a href="http://open.umich.edu/" target="_new">open.umich.edu</a>) efforts
on campus.
<p>
I generally make all my courses available as OER materials:
<ul>
<li>As I teach each semester, I make my materials instantly available as they
are created on the sites
<a href="http://www.py4e.com/" target="_new">Python for Everybody</a> and
<a href="http://www.wa4e.com/" target="_new">Web Applications for Everybody</a>.
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Other teaching</h2>
