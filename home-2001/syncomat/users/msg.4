Hello, this is my mailing list for the lecture making program
Sync-O-Matic 3000.  

I am getting ready to release the next revision (1.5) of SM-3000.

This version has lots of new cool features.

-  Improved style capabilities - much more powerful and flexible
-  Convient features to reduce the number of manual Clicks to get simple tasks done
-  A little icon for the program instead of the deafult icon 
   (Very important feature)

The code is pretty much ready - I need to port my styles to the new approach.

I have three questions:

1) Do you have anything that really bugs you about the program 
that I could fix in this next release?

2) Have you made your own style files?  If so, how complex are they?

3) If you are regularly using the program, let me know - I might want to 
Beta test the new version a bit

Please let me know at crs@msu.edu

This is a hand-maintained list - just reply if you want to get dropped.
