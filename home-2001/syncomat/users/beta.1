Sync-O-Matic 2000 Alpha Test Newsletter-0
Fri Apr 21 13:02:30 EDT 2000

Howdy.  Notice the new heading - this note is going to a reduced list
of the more active Sync-O-Matic users.  Feel free to let me know that
you don't want to hear all the Alpha-Test Blah blah.  You can be 
removed from the alpha list and stay on the normal list where more of
the major releases will be disucssed.

Alpha version 1 of Sync-O-Matic 2000 is up at (new URL)

http://www.netfact.com/syncomat/  (soon to be www.syncomat.com)

There is not muych there - one page of text and a ZIP file.  But it seems to 
work in the testing I have done.  Feel free to check it out and 
download it.  The super-secret password for this file is "joe" :)

For the next two weeks, I will be touching the code nearly every day with 
improvements and bug fixes, so I would much appreciate it if you tried this 
out and gave me lots of feedback.  We can even talk on the phone if 
necessary.

I will be developing some way-cool documentation in the next few weeks as 
well.

I have tried to make the new realease as upwards compatible as possible,
but may have missed something.  For you intiial testing, it would be best if 
you used Sync-O-Matic 2000 on new directories to see how it works, and then 
later start pointing at the htm_sld dirctories from the previous version.

I am MOST CURIOUS about how well the audio/video recording stuff works in
different environments.  I already found a problem on NT that I am tracking
down.  I need to know if different OS/Camera combintions have problems.

I have a request as a graphically-challenged engineer-type - I would much
appreciate it if someone could come up with some graphic elements to make
the interface look like something other than a Visual Basic programmer 
nightmare.  The pay is not so great - but think of the pride you would
get...  The problem is that it is hard to get into writing some documentation
when the look and feel of the UI is not tied down somewhat.
