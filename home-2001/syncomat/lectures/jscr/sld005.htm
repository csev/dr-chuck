Both Java and JavaScript are used widely in Web page design, but they are completely separate languages.  Java is a full-fledged computer programming language, and the code must be compiled (translated) before the computer can interpret it.  Java code is stored in a separate file and is identified with the HTML tag &#060APPLET&#062.

JavaScript is not compiled and is written directly into the HTML document, using the tag &#060SCRIPT&#062. JavaScript accomplishes many of the same tasks Java is used for, but is not compiled.  Instead, it is downloaded by the user’s Internet browser and run on their computer (the client).

Java is currently less reliable than JavaScript, and computers with earlier versions of Internet browsers often crash when trying to open a Java program.  Because JavaScript allows client-side functionality, it is generally faster than Java programs.
