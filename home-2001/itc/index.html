The Instructional Technology Committee was formed in the Fall of 1999 and 
charged with finding a way to assess the instructional technology efforts 
across the College and develop a plan to enhance those efforts and the
visibility of those efforts.  The chair of the committee is Scott Fogler 
(sfogler@engin.umich.edu).  The 
<a href=members.htm>membership</a> is drawn from various constituencies
throughout the College.
<h3>Survey</h3>
Please participate in the faculty survey.  It only should take about 5 minutes of your time.

<h3>Other Resources</h3>
This section points to other resources which may be useful 
to Engineering Faculty
<ul>
<li>
<a href=http://www.umich.edu/~teachtec/ target=_new>The Teaching and Technology Collaborative</a> works to connect faculty to services and resources on campus.  They have
an annual week-long event in the Spring of the year.
In 2000, the event is 
<a href=http://www.umich.edu/~teachtec/ES2000/ target=_new>May 8-12, 2000</a>.
The site also has a matrix of instructional technology resources on campus.
<p>
<li>
the <a href=http://www.umich.edu/~crltmich/ target=_new>Center for Research on Teaching and
Learning</a> is dedicated to supporting improvements in teaching and learning.  These efforts range from workshops to course assessment programs.
<p>
<li>
<a href=http://coursetools.ummu.umich.edu/ target=_new>UM Coursetools</a> is a suite of
tools for course management, communication, and management.   Coursetools
allows any instructor in any UMich class to quickly create a high quality
website for the course.  While coursetools is intended to be usable without
significant training, workshops on its use are available.  
<p>
<li>
<a href=http://www.ummu.umich.edu/learnTech/index.html target=_new>Learning Technologies</a>
group which is part of the Media Union
<a href=http://www.ummu.umich.edu/faculty%20studio/facultystudio.html target=_new>
Faculty Studio</a> provides support for Coursetools.  As the rollout of 
Coursetools completes, the Learning Technologies group will begin to work 
with individual faculty on innovative uses of tools for teaching and learning.
</ul>
<h3>Registry of Course Web Sites</h3>
The committee would like to maintain a list of courses which can serve
as examples of good use of educational technology.  Please send relavent URLs
to the committee webmaster Charles Severance (csev@umich.edu) if you are involved in such a course.
