<h1>Changes in This version</h1>
Sync-O-Matic 2000 Version Beta-5 
<p>
This version follows close on the heels of Beta-4 so you should check there for new features too.
<p>
The major addition in this version is the fact that Sync-O-Matic can be "automated"
using Visual Basic.  Sync-O-Matic is an "ActiveX Exe"  This means that when you execute 
it normally it operates the same as before.
<p>
However when you add a reference to the .exe file to a VB project, you have access to a API 
which allows you to control Sync-O-Matic directly.  
<p>
Here is some simple code:
<pre>
    Dim Bob As New syncomatic
    Dim QuitMsg As String
    Dim Tmp As String
   
    Bob.SetTextPP txtPP.Text ' Sets default values for lots of the directories
    
    ' Now we will override some of those
    
    Bob.SetTextWebDir txtWebDir.Text
    Bob.SetOptCD False
    Bob.SetOptWeb True
    Bob.SetOptStream False
    Bob.SetTextWebURL txtWebURL.Text
    MsgBox "Yo" ' Pause for a moment so the user can play with Sync-O-Matic
    If Not Bob.OKToPublish(QuitMsg) Then
        MsgBox "Cannot publish - " & QuitMsg
        Exit Sub
    End If
    
    ' This will actually block while the non-batchfile stuff
    ' is executed - this can take from 10 to 60 seconds to complete
    
    If Not Bob.Publish(QuitMsg) Then
        MsgBox "Publish aborted - " & QuitMsg
        Exit Sub
    End If

    ' The "lazy" way to go
    ' Bob.WaitUntilComplete
    
    ' The more "interactive approach"
    ' This will loop waiting for the batch file to complete
    ' When the RealProducer ActiveX control is used this will be about a second
    ' When RealProducer 5 is used this may be a minute or so
    
    While Bob.IsRunning()
        Bob.GetStatus (Tmp)
        lblStatus.Caption = Tmp
        DoEvents ' make sure to add this
    Wend
</pre>

The source for this entire application is available at

<p>
This has a number of applications - You can write your own "Server Mode" of Sync-O-Matic,
developing your own conventions for file storage, etc.  Another thing you could do is look through
a directory of unpublished lectures, checking the relative dates of files (like make on UNIX) and
publishing directories which have been updated...
<p>
At the end of the day, you could just want to put your own UI on Sync-O-Matic.
<p>
This is a new feature so there may be some things that you would
