This is my mailing list for the lecture making program Sync-O-Matic 3000.  

I am preparing to release version 1.7 of Sync-O-Matic.  The significant
feature is the support of the G2 series of software (so far SM-3000 only
likes RealPlayer 5.0 or earlier).  There is still a tiny bug but I have
worked around it.

I also added a feature to make the use of image maps (CTRL-K) in
PowerPoint more convienent (thanks Aneema for the request).

I will be releasing it in a week or so.  If there are any little
annoying things that should be fixed, let me know so I can incorporate
them into this release.

P.S. I would much appreciate it if anyone could tell me how to determine
the default browser from Visual Basic.  Would save an annoying message
in SM version 1.7 because of the above mentioned tiny bug.
