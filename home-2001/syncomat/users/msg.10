Update on the continuing saga fo Sync-O-Matic 1.7.  

(1) Fixed a tiny bug that made audio-only (.ra files) not work with G2.
(2) Created a new audio-only style "audio" which expects audio
in the .rm files.  This makes more sense because in G2 everything is a rm.
(3) Real has a new release of the player (6.0.3.143 or later) that fixes
the ActiveX plug-in so I can remove my "testing" hack and make it work
like it in previous versions.  (Thanks Haydon)
