<h2>Books Written</h2>
<p>
Wrote the second edition of the O'Reilly book on 
High Performance Computing, July 1998.
<p>
<p>
Wrote the book, <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596800697/" target="_new">
Using Google App Engine
 Using Google App Engine - 
 Building Web Applications
</a>, Published by O'Reilly and Associates,
 ISBN 10: 0-596-80069-X | ISBN 13: 9780596800697, May 2009.
<h2>Software Developed:</h2>
<p>
I developed a tool called Sync-O-Matic 3000 which automates the production
of web-lectures using RealNetworks media and HTML.  This product is in use
at a number of sites around the world and is downloaded several times
each week.  The best example of its use is the CERN Web lecture repository
<a href=http://webcast.cern.ch/Projects/WebLectureArchive/>
http://webcast.cern.ch/Projects/WebLectureArchive/</a>.
<p>
To address some of the usability problems in Sync-O-Matic,
I developed a tool called ClipBoard-2000 which also produces web-based
lectures using Quicktime.  ClipBoard-2000 is very easy to use and it
allows the instructor to annotate their slides with text and drawing.
ClipBoard also allows the instructors to use a document camera to
show objects in their lectures.
ClipBoard is early in the development process but has generated significant
interest from both commercial and educational institutions.
<p>
Between 2004 and 2007, I was the chief architect of the Mellon-funded Sakai Project
and later the executive director of the non-profit Sakai Foundation.  I was a principle
designer and developer for the Sakai 1.x and 2.x products.  Sakai is in use at over 200
schools with well over a million users who use it for teaching, learning, 
and collaboration.
