This document attempts to begin to make a list of the institutions which seem
to have an edge over the University of Michigan College of 
Engineering in terms of using technology in education.  This list is by 
its nature incomplete and the analysis of each institution is also 
incomplete.  Comments, criticisms, and suggestions are welcome at 
any time by sending E-Mail to csev@umich.edu.

<h3>Activities At the University of Michigan</h3>
While this survey is intended to find areas for improvement in educational 
technology, there are a number of strong areas already at Michigan.  
These include:
<ul>
<li><a href=http://www.umich.edu/~crltmich/>The Center for Research in Teaching
and Learning</a> - This is a campus wide resource to help teachers and 
learners.  For exmaple, the CRLT can work with a faculty member to do an assessment on their course to find  ways to improve the teaching and learning 
in their course.
<li><a href=http://coursetools.ummu.umich.edu/>Um.Coursetools</a> is a campus 
wide effort to provide base level web-based learning infrastructure to 
<i>every</i> course on campus.  Cousetools is unique in that it can be 
used by every single teacher on campus without any special effort on the 
part of the teacher.  This is accomplished by highly integrating the 
UM.Coursetools services into the business processes of the university.
<li><a href=http://cpd.engin.umich.edu/>Center for Professional 
Development</a> (College of Engineering) - This is a very strong distance 
education effort aimed primarily at the professional effort.  CPD uses a
wide variety of technology in the delivery of distance education from
video tapes via FedEx to streaming video over the internet.
</ul>
<h3>Types of Efforts</h3>
The efforts at most universities fall into one of several categories:
<ul>
<li>
Research-active faculty members in Computer Science and Engineering who
view Educational Technology as one of their personal research areas.
These faculty are writing grants, supervising graduate students,
writing papers, and presenting results
at conferences such as 
<a href=http://fairway.ecn.purdue.edu/~fie/>Frontiers in Education</a>
and 
<a href=http://www.asee.org/conferences/>ASEE</a>.  General theme areas 
include tool development, assessment and evaluation, 
human computer interaction, and others.
Classic examples: Georgia Tech and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
<li>
A university wide activity targeted at getting courses on-line across all 
of campus often with a focus on new sources of revenue such as 
distance education students, high-school students, or adult learners.
These efforts often come out of the CIO or Provost's office and have
specific funding to assist faculty to put their courses on-line.  Usually
the central adminstration is expecting som sort of financial payoff for their
investment.  These are often called "virtual universities" or "UWOnline".
Classic Examples: Michigan State University Virtual University
<li>
Efforts which have grown out of the College of Education/Educational 
Technology efforts.  These efforts generally are done by collaborating with
an active teacher and doing education-oriented evaluation and research
on how teaching can be improved.  The CRLT and (formerly) Office 
of Instructional Technology at Michigan are classic examples of this type 
of effort.
<li>
Especially in the Engineering field,
Professional Development/Continuing Education services are well developed.
Engineers graduating with a Bachelors degree quickly find themselves in need 
of a Master's degree with no time to go back to school full time.  Often
their employer will pay for their further education if it can be convienently 
delivered to the student without major interruption to their work.  
Enterprising schools have developed programs to meet these needs.  Because
there is revenue associated with the teaching of these courses, these 
activities are generally done quite well.  Any field which has a significant
continuing education component (Medcine is a good example) will also tend
to have this type of program.
The Center for Professional Development in the College of
Engineering is an excellent example of this type of operation.
</ul>
<h3>Peer Institutions</h3>
In this section, I try to identify some peer institutions to see some examples
of these types of efforts.  For each school, I assign a ranking called the 
"Chuck's jealosy factor" (perhaps we can do a more thorough evaluation and come
up with an impartial evalation).  In my ranking I include how well the 
activities are represented to the outside world on the web.  Part of the goal
is to use educational technology to teach well.  Yet another part of the 
puzzle is making sure you (and your institution) get some credit for it.
The scale ranges from 1 (very jealous) to 5 (not so jealous).
<ul>
<li> <b>Georgia Tech</b> - This is a classic example of a Computer 
Science Department with Educational technology as one of its Foci.
The 
<a href=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fce/pubs/icse99/node6.html>ClassRoom 2000</a>
effort is well known and well publicized.  The faculty member involved is
<a href=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Gregory.Abowd/>Gregory Abowd</a> - he
is well knwn and well published in this area. (Rating=1)
<p>
<li>
<b>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</b> -
The <a href=http://w3.scale.uiuc.edu/scale/>SCALE</a> project at UIUC is
also very well known.  This effort is funded by a large grant from the Sloan
Foundation and is focussed on studying asynchronous learning.  The goal is
to have a broad impact across thecampus and improve teaching efficiency.
The effort has a significant effort on the UIUC campus and is well publicized
at national meetings.
(Rating=2)
<p>
<li>
<b>Stanford</b> - The 
<a href=http://scpd.stanford.edu/>Stanford Center for Professional 
Development</a> is an excellent example of using technology in distance 
and continuing education.  Their location in Silicon Valley makes this a very 
natural effort.  Stanford is viewed as a leader in technical innovations with
some of the very first web-based video lectures in the world and the first with
an on-line masters degree.  This leadership was also driven by 
Computer Science faculty activities.  The technology which is now Micrsoft
Media Player was initially developed at Stanford by Anoop Gupta, now with
Microsoft Research.  
(Rating = 2)
<p>
<li>
<b>Rensselaer</b> - Rensselaer also has a strong
<a href=http://www.pde.rpi.edu/academics/>Professional Development</a> effort
and provides 17 
<a href=http://www.pde.rpi.edu/academics/degrees/degrees.html>Masters 
Degrees</a> 
in Engineering and Business
to off-campus students.
(Rating=2)
<p>
<li>
<b>Carnegie-Mellon University</b> - There are a 
<a href=http://www.cmu.edu/acs/telab/Ed/Education_distance_data.html>
number of efforts</a> going on at CMU.  
Many of the efforts seem independent without a campus 
(or even colleg-wide basis).
<a href=http://online.web.cmu.edu/public/information/publications/overview/index.html>CMU OnLine</a> which is a "Virtual University" style operation
supporting a limited number of courses.  
It was nice to find a page which acted as a 
<a href=http://www.cmu.edu/acs/telab/Ed/Education_distance_data.html>
ClearingHouse for the various Educational Technology Efforts. 
(Rating=3).

Virginia Tech Online (Rating=3)

Penn State's World Campus (Rating=4)
