Sync-O-Matic 3000 Newsletter: Number 13

Version 1.8 is up on the web.  New features include the ability to make
G2 only lectures.  This required some changes to the code and a new
style "g2".  So you need both version 1.8 and a new syncinfo.zip file.

I need some help with the G2 style - it is a just a rough style.  I have
not yet figured out how to put SMIL stuff on a server (G2 or http).  Any
help would be much appreciated.  I also need to figure out how to 
do random access wit smil files as well.

This version also includes a fix for the dreaded "Runtime Error 5" 
error that was reported from time to time.

I also have written some initial documentation on how style files work
