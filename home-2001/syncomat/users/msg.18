Sync-O-Matic Newsletter-19

Howdy folks.  Sync-O-Matic version 1.12 is now up and available.  
It is the largest rewrite of the software for several years and 
implements much of the technology I have developed for the 
"super-streamlined" Sync-O-Matic version 2.0.

With this many new features, I am expecting a few weeks of 
"shakedown" early in April.  There may be a couple of quick 
bug-fix releases as users get their hands on it.  I
expect to be able to respond quickly to errors to get to 
a stable release as soon  as possible.  For a few weeks it is 
a good to think of this as a "beta".  Keep a copy
of version 1.11 (solid as a rock - and just as much fun) 
so you can go back and forth (uninstall/reinstall) if 
you encounter problems.

Most of the changes fall into the reliability/ease of 
use area.  A detailed list of new features is available on the web site 

http://www.netfact.com/crs/projects/syncomat/install/

Here is a short summary:

- A mode where the media and PowerPoint Output are in 
  the same directory
- The ability to publish from ClipBoard-2000 (my other 
  product) media into Real
- Integration of the RealProducer into ClipBoard-2000.  
- Error checking and cleanup of the Make Lecture Process
- Removal of the ".rm is audio" box - this detection 
  is now done automatically

I hope that some more experienced users will download and test 
the software and get me some quick feedback.

Now that this is out, I can focus my attention on the next 
major release (Version 2.0).
