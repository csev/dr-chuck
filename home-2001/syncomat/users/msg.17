Sync-O-Matic 3000 Newsletter: Number 17
Fri Mar 10 09:08:58 EST 2000

It has been seven (7) months since I have sent out a Sync-O-Matic users 
message (how is that for NOT wasting your time).  A lot has happened with
my new project ClipBoard and things are starting to happen again on 
Sync-O-Matic.    So I thought I would let folks know what is up and what 
is in the future plans.

I have been pretty much heads-down working on my Mac-based product called
ClipBoard-2000 - this has turned out to be quite a cute little program.
Unlike Sync-O-Matic-3000 it is easy to intstall, setup and get working.
If you have access to a Macintosh I highly recommend that you download it
and play with it.  The site for it is

On the Sync-O-Matic side, now that I have ClipBoard under control, I am off 
on a number of tangents.  

I am working on a completely new Sync-O-Matic (I call it Sync-O-Matic-2000)
with a focus on ease of installation and use.  You should be able to produce
a lecture with very few mouse clicks.  I have a prototype of this working with
the following features: (1) Automatic import from PowerPoint (no more Save As
HTML), (2) RealProducer is built-in to Sync-O-Matic - you do not have to 
separately install RealProducer, (3) Sync-O-Matic directly controls the 
RealProducer (no more cryptic dialog boxes), and (4) simplified Make Lecture
and improved lecture Upload.  I also have a bunch of features in mind that
I will tell you about later when I get them working.  For existing users of
Symc-O-Matic 3000, the new product may seem somewhat less powerful and 
flexible - but it will be MUCH easier to use.

As I develop new technology for Sync-O-Matic 2000, I am back-porting some of it
to Sync-O-Matic-3000.  I intend to release a version 1.12 of Sync-O-Matic 3000
which looks a lot like the existing sync-o-matic but with some 
improvements including: (1) The ability to import a ClipBoard recorded lecture
and publish as a Sync-O-Mat lecture and (2) Build in RealProducer and others.

Another plan that I have in mind is to create a "server-edition" of
Sync-O-Matic 2000.   With this, you will be able to upload Sync-O-Matic
Lecture materials (PPT, Timing, and media) to an NT server with IIS, ASP, 
and Sync-O-Matic Server edition, and Sync-O-Matic Server Edition will do the
publishing of the lecture (in as many different styles as you like) dynamically
on the fly :).  This will revolutionize our ability to archive, move, and reuse
content and improve overall usability for lecture creators.

In terms of documentation and support effort, I do not plan to update 
the documentation of Sync-O-Matic-3000 at all. As such, when I release version
1.12 the new features will be undocumented (unless I add stuff to a FAQ).
Version 1.12 is intended for existing users and those users who want to 
integrate ClipBoard and Sync-O-Matic.  But because it will work so much better
than Version 1.11 in some areas, the fact that the documentation will be
out-of-date is somewhat mute..

Sync-O-Matic 2000 will be documented thoroughly as part of that project.  
Because this new release is simpler and cleaner, writing good documentation 
will not be such a chore.

As this unfolds, I will be making announcements to the list.  Once I 
have version 1.12 of Sync-O-Matic 3000 released, I will spend some time
working on the design of Sync-O-Matic 2000 - as part of that, I will be asking
the existing users of Sync-O-Matic what they like and dislike about the 
product.  I think that I have a pretty good idea as to where the big strengths
and weaknesses are (being the one-man tech support crew all these years), but
there may be subtle things that I can quickly fix in the new version.  I will
be releasing Alpha releases of Sync-O-Matic 2000 and I encourage you to 
download these and give me your feedback.

I look forward to these next few months and finally getting to do a decent job
on Sync-O-Matic.  I would like to thank you for giving Sync-O-Matic a try, and
if you were disappointed in how difficult it was to use, the time is coming 
soon that you should give it another try (Don't bother with version 1.12 - it
won't be THAT much better).

When released, Sync-O-Matic 2000 will continue to be available at no 
cost and no restrictions on the materials produced by Sync-O-Matic 
(commercial or educational).  I may come up with some way to sell a 
CD and printed documentation or make money on support, but the software
will continue to be free.  Over the years, I have just found over and
over that the best things in life (and the best quality software) are 
free.
