Version 1.7 of Sync-O-Matic is now up for download at the standard
location http://www.egr.msu.edu/~crs/projects/syncomat/install/
You should download and install both the sync.zip and syncinfo.zip files
as there have been some subtle style file changes in this release.

Version 1.7 supports RealPlayer G2.  Also Version 1.7 improves on the 
processing of hyperlinked objects in PowerPoint which become web hot
spots.

Dr. Enbody and I are planning a Sync-O-Matic workshop at the 1999 
Frontiers in Education conference in November.  I would be curious if 
there would be any interest in attending the workshop.

The good news is that if we do a workshop, it will force us to write
good documentation (finally).

The call for abstracts is January 8 (day after tomorrow).  It would be
cool to see a couple of SM-3000 papers.  All that is necesary is a well
written 300 word abstract.
