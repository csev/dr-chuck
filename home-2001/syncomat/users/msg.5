Hello, this is my mailing list for the lecture making program
Sync-O-Matic 3000.  

Hello - I have a Beta Release of Sync-O-Matic 1.6  It has lots of new
features, new styles, has been recompiled under Visual Basic 6.0, has an
automatic test button and an automatic FTP capability - also the styles
are niftier looking and more tolerant to RealPlayer G2 Beta and 
its funkiness.  Thanks to VB6.0 the overall size of the files is 
about 2.5 MB, down from 7MB.

The URL is

If you had problems with installation on NT, try this new release.  If 
you are happy with the old release don't bother - let some others figure
out the bugs.  Some pieces of code (the auto-FTP) are less than 1 hour
old as I type this message - It worked once though.

Please let me know at crs@msu.edu

This is a hand-maintained list - just reply if you want to get dropped.

P.S. I just got VB 6.0 and came back from a Microsoft Developer's
Conference so I got all cranked up and had to write some code to 
see how VB6.0 handled :).
