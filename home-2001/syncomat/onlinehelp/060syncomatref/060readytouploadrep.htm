Once a lecture has been recorded, you can either publish it to the hard disk or to the web.
<P>
Another option is to upload the raw materials necessary to publish the lecture to some type of repository.

In some ultimate future, repositories will exist which can automatically "publish" Sync-O-Matic lectures, but in the short term, typically some human "Lecture-master" will be doing the publish process for these lectures uploaded to a "repository".
