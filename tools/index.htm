Software tools</h2>
This page points to three basic areas of software which I have developed.
<ul>
<li>Educational software for children
<li>Software to support technology-based education
<li>General utility software
</ul>
Feel free to send me a note about the software.  Some of the products
have mail groups at Yahoo.  For those products, it is best to post to 
the mail groups because often other users respond more quickly than I do.

<h3>Educational software for children</h3>
<a href=drtimes/drtimes.zip>
<img src=drtimes.gif align=right>
</a>
<h4>Dr. Times</h4>
<p>
This is a simple tool which can be used to practice multiplication tables
and addition tables.  It has support for audio and several modes to provide 
some type of assistance.  You can replace the sounds with your own voice.
I hope to rewrite the application using VB.NET in a way which allows voice
input as a way to answer the questions.  I also want to make it smarter to
have a sense of where the student has strengths and weaknesses.

<h3>Software to support technology-based education</h3>

</a>
<h4>Clipboard-2000</h4>
<p>
This is a tool which works on the PC and Macintosh to easily produce QuickTime
movies which include video, audio, sildes, scribbling, typing, and annotation.  The
tool can be used to record live lectures or to create material expressly for 
offline viewing.  It also has a "server mode" where it can be coupled wwith Media
Cleaner Pro to dynamically produce lectures as a lecture publishing server.  There
is a user group for technical support at
<a href=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/cb2k/ target=_new>Yahoo Groups</a>.  The download
site contains many samples of ClipBoard lectures.

<h4>Sync-O-Matic 2000</h4>
<p>
This is another tool to create distance lectures using the Real Media technologies.
Sync-O-Matic is somewhat more difficult to use than ClipBoard for the lone
user, but it has a significant number of features which make it well suited
for a production facility making lectures.  Probably the best example of a large
repository of Sync-O-Matic lectures is the
<a href=http://webcast.cern.ch/Projects/WebLectureArchive/ target=_new>
Cern Web Lecture Archive
</a> in Geneva Switzerland.  A user discussion group is available on
<a href=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/syncomat/ target=_new>Yahoo Groups</a>.

<h2>General utility software</h2>

<a href=sms-images/pop-v2.tar>
<img src=icon.gif border=0>
</a>
<h4>V300 Image Retrieval - Uses PHP to retrive images</h4>
<p>
This software connects to a POP address and downloads mail parsing 
and extracting the JPG attachments and automatically maintaining
an online album of those images.  Also supports metadata for each 
image.

<h4>MAKEHTM - A tool for photo Albums</h4>
<p>
Makehtm is a simple tool which makes web pages for a set of photos.  I don't
(yet) have very good documentation, but the idea is to put a bunch of images
from a digital camera into a directory with some alphabetical naming convention.
Then use makehtm to put a little annotation along with each photo using the Edit
feature.  Then Makehtm will create thumnails and a bunch of .htm files to 
make the narrated photo album.  Here is an
<a href=makehtm/00-07-10-powerboat/index.htm target=_new>
example</a> of the narrated pictures.
If I get some interest I would gladly spend some
time to improve this tool - let me know what you think.

<H4>ARPYOURBASE</h4>
This tool is only useful for a small segment of the population.  This tool
is absolutely necessary when you are using an Apple Airport to act both as a 
wireless gateway and a home dial-up Internet router <i>and</i> you 
want to use PC's running
Windows-98 and Windows-95 on the Ethernet segments of your network.  There is a 
problem with ARP entries (it is hard to assign the blame between Apple and Microsoft,
both work poorly).  The solution is to force a refresh of the ARP entry for the 
gateway every 100 seconds.  This little tool does that in a nice convienent way.
Source code is included in the download and shows how to do some nifty IP
operations from Visual Basic.

<H3>Summary</h3>
<p>
I write software because I find it enjoyable.  I have used so much high quality
free software during my career that I feel that I should give something back
to the commmunity.
