<h1>Changes in This version</h1>
Sync-O-Matic 2000 Version Alpha-7B
<p>
Changes:
<ul>
<li>
Changed the moment where it checks for the existance of the RealProducer control.  Earlier
versions checked immediately upon load.  Now the check is delayed until the last possible
moment - typically the make lecture or record lecture process.  Added checks everywhaere the
RealProducer or RealPlayer ActiveX control is loaded.
<li>
Added buttons for RealProducer Plus to the Compatibility section of Prefs.
<li>
Tested using compatibility mode - Found lots of little problems with paths with spaces in them - added double quotes around them - where I found them - there may be tiny problems that I missed with a particular version of RealProducer as far back as 3.0.
<li>
Fixed a bug where the "Auto-Executing" hung and never went to "Process Done" on NT.  You guessed it - spaces in the path name.  
<li>
Removed the feature (which I assume no one uses) where there was a "net" and "local" subdirectory within the "copy" directory.
</ul>
<p>
While this fixes a few bugs, in general there is not much new since A6.  That is a good sign.  Full documentation should be forthcoming soon.
<h3>To Do</h3>
