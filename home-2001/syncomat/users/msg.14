Sync-O-Matic 3000 Newsletter: Number 14

Howdy - my last Sync-O-Mat note was back in February.  Lots of things
are brewing.  I will be leaving MSU and joining the University of
Michigan May 24.  The transistion has kept me way too busy.  Sorry if I
have not been responsive with the E-Mail questions.

I am making arrangements to continue to support Sync-O-Matic as an
individual.  New versions and bug fixes will continue to come out.
Writing good documentation is a very high priority early in the 
Summer.

If you want to get the latest version of the software go to 
http://www.netfact.com/~crs/projects/syncomat/

Part of the arrangements with MSU will probably lead to the ability to
license source code for a small fee.  My feeling is that if an
organization decides to really use the software in a pseudo-production 
mode, they should probably have source code in case my web server 
gets inadvertently unpluggged.  Or they can fix bugs without waiting
three weeks for me to catch up on my E-Mail.

I have created a mailing list for Sync-O-Matic users at

syncomat-users@egroups.com

Subscribe by sending a note to:

syncomat-users-subscribe@egroups.com

I expect that version 1.10 will be out by June 1.  With really cool
G2 support and some bug fixes.
