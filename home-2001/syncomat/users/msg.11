Sync-O-Matic 3000 Newsletter: Number 11

I have started working on the next major revision to Sync-O-Matic.  I 
might call this one 2.0 :).

One of my goals is to take advantage of the new RealPlayer G2 features.
Another goal is that you don't have to do anything special for the G2
lectures.  So far, it seems that I can do it all in style files so you
will be able to reuse all of your audio and video material and republish
them to make new G2 versions of the same stuff.  Another anticipated 
benefit of G2 is that lectures will be portable from server to server
(i.e. no hardcoded URLS, all references are relative).

This is what I have so far:

http://www.vu.msu.edu/preview/egr124/lectures/filmg2/filmg2.zip

Download into a temp directory and unzip - open index.htm and follow
directions.   Needs work - I have to still figure out if such a
presentation can be pseudo-streamed of if the G2 server is required.

Anyone with G2 skills that can show me how to alter the above
presentation for pseudo-streaming, I would appreciate it.
